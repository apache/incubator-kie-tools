## @kie-tools-scripts/build-env

Helps packages inside a monorepo to define environment variables and consume them easily.

This package allows packages to consume environment variables in a cross-platform way, while maintaining a documented list of variables that are defined.

Environment variables are not directly consumed, but rather used to create properties with a more comprehensive structure.

Env definition files are plain JavaScript, allowing for better flexibility and use through the CLI or direct imports on other JavaScript files, such as Webpack configuration files.

### Usage

- `build-env {dot.separated.property}`
  - Returns the value of a property. See available properties with `build-env --print-env`.
    - e.g. `build-env root.version` prints `0.0.0`.
  - It's possible to negate boolean values with the `--not flag.`
    - e.g. If `build-env build.runTests` prints `true`, then e.g. `build-env build.runTests --not` prints `false`
- `build-env --print-vars`
  - Prints the env var names.
- `build-env --print-env-json`
  - Prints the JSON object for this env.
- `build-env --print-dotenv`
  - Prints variables assigned to values in .env format.

> You can append `:self` to any of the three commands above to see results that ignore composition with other envs.

### Configuration

- `build-env` will recursively scan for an `env` directory with an `index.js` file inside, starting from the current directory until `env/index.js` (or a file called `.build-env-root`) is found.

- `env/index.js` files should export `vars` and `env`. See the example below.

- To compose an env with another one, use the `composeEnv` function.

### Example

Given the following package structure in a monorepo:

- packages/a/env/index.js

```js
const { varsWithName, getOrDefault } = require("@kie-tools-scripts/build-env");

module.exports = {
  vars: varsWithName({
    MY_VAR: {
      default: `foo`,
      description: "My env var",
    },
  }),
  get env() {
    return {
      myProperty: getOrDefault(this.vars.MY_VAR),
    };
  },
};
```

- packages/b/env/index.js

```js
const { varsWithName, getOrDefault, composeEnv } = require("@kie-tools-scripts/build-env");

module.exports = composeEnv([require("a/env")], {
  vars: varsWithName({
    MY_OTHER_VAR: {
      default: `bar`,
      description: "My other env var",
    },
  }),
  get env() {
    return {
      myOtherProperty: getOrDefault(this.vars.MY_OTHER_VAR),
    };
  },
});
```

Executing build-env will give you these results:

```bash
# With default values:
$ cd ~/[my-repo]/packages/a
$ build-env myProperty
foo
$ build-env myOtherProperty
[build-env] Env property 'myOtherProperty' not found.
[build-env] See all env properties with 'build-env --print-env-json'

$ cd ~/[my-repo]/packages/b
$ build-env myProperty
foo
$ build-env myOtherProperty
bar

# With custom value:
$ export MY_VAR='fooz'
$ cd ~/[my-repo]/packages/a
$ build-env myProperty
fooz
$ cd ~/[my-repo]/packages/b
$ build-env myProperty
fooz
```

Apache KIE (incubating) is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software
Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the name of Apache Incubator. Incubation is
required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that
the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized
in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation
status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the
code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.

Some of the incubating projectâ€™s releases may not be fully compliant with ASF
policy. For example, releases may have incomplete or un-reviewed licensing
conditions. What follows is a list of known issues the project is currently
aware of (note that this list, by definition, is likely to be incomplete):

- Hibernate, an LGPL project, is being used. Hibernate is in the process of
  relicensing to ASL v2
- Some files, particularly test files, and those not supporting comments, may
  be missing the ASF Licensing Header

If you are planning to incorporate this work into your product/project, please
be aware that you will need to conduct a thorough licensing review to determine
the overall implications of including this work. For the current status of this
project through the Apache Incubator visit:
