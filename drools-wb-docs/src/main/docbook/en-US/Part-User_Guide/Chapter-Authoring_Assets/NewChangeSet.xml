  <title>Change-Set</title>

  <para>Change-set is one of the ways Drools has to group one or more 
  Assets in a single Asset. Change-sets can then be added to a 
  Knowledge Builder or a Knowledge Agent to process all the assets referenced
  by it.</para>

  <para>By default, Guvnor provides a unique Change-Set per package containing 
  the package binary or the drl source. The main problem with this is when you 
  want to use just a sub-set of assets of a package (or even from different 
  packages) in your application.</para>

  <para>Using the Change-Set editor you can define your own change-sets inside 
  Guvnor in any way you want. You could have a combination of different assets 
  and packages, or even different snapshots of a package in a change-set. 
  You can have all the change-sets per package you need, so if different 
  applications are using the same package in different ways 
  (different assets or assets' versions of a same package) you can make use of 
  this feature of Guvnor.</para>
