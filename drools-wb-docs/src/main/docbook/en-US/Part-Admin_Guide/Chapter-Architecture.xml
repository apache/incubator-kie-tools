  <title>Architecture</title>

  <para>This section covers the technical aspects of Guvnor, it is not necessary to use this if you are integrating or
  an end user of the application. However, Drools is open source, so build instructions form part of the manual.</para>

  <para>You may want to build from source if you want to re-use components, or embed the application within
  another.</para>

  <para>The above diagram shows the major components of the system and how they integrate and are deployed. The User
  Guide has more details on the parts that are highly configurable (e.g. database).</para>

  <para>Guvnor is deployed as a WAR, which provides user interfaces over the web, and provides binary packages using
  URLs (or files). It uses the JSR-170 standard for data storage (JCR). JBoss Seam is used as the component framework,
  and GWT is used as the widget toolkit for constructing the AJAX-based web user interface.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Building from source</title>

    <para>This section will go over the steps necessary to build various components. Mostly this is automated, but the
    manual process is described for thoroughness.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Modules</title>

      <para>There are 2 modules: <systemitem>guvnor-repository</systemitem> (back end) and
      <systemitem>guvnor-webapp</systemitem> (front end and rules integration). The
      <systemitem>guvnor-webapp</systemitem> module depends on the <systemitem>guvnor-repository</systemitem> module, as
      well as other components. Guvnor is part of the main build for all of Drools - when building Drools, Guvnor is
      built alongside it.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Working with Maven 2</title>

      <para>Maven 2 is used as the build system. To get started, the <emphasis>whole</emphasis> of the source tree for
      JBoss Rules needs to be checked out. This includes the other modules, and the top level lib and repository
      directories (which are needed by the build); as the Guvnor build is part of the main Drools build.</para>

      <para>Initially, go into the root of the jboss-rules checked out source tree, and run <command>mvn
      install</command> to install all the components for the inter-project dependencies. If the build is broken (all
      care is taken for this eventuality not to occur), the flag <command>-DskipTests</command> can be used to prevent
      failing unit tests from preventing the build.</para>

      <para>When wishing to build Guvnor, go into the guvnor-webapp directory, and run <command>mvn package</command>.
      This will run the tests, and then build a deployable WAR. Once the WAR file is in the target directory, the Guvnor
      is ready to go.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Working with GWT</title>

      <para>The GUI widgets for the web front end are developed with GWT (Google Web Toolkit).</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Debugging, Editing and running with Eclipse</title>

      <para>Each module has a ready to go and up to date eclipse project configuration, so they can merely be imported
      into the eclipse workspace. These projects are generated by Maven. Use the <command>mvn eclipse:eclipse</command>
      command to refresh them in case they are wrong or outdated. They have been manually modified to have project
      dependencies which means that the code can be stepped through when debugging.</para>

      <para>Some environment variables are required in eclipse (for Window: <code>&gt;Preferences-&gt;Java-&gt;Build
      path-&gt;</code> Classpath variables): the <code>M2_REPO</code>, as normal, to point to where Maven downloads
      shared dependencies. <code>GWT_HOME</code> should point to where you installed GWT. <code>GWT_DEV</code> must
      point to the platform specific "dev" JAR that ships with the version of GWT you have.</para>

      <para>How to launch from Eclipse: unit tests can be launched, as normal (in which case only <code>M2_REPO</code>
      setup is needed, GWT does not need to be downloaded separately), or it can be launched it in <emphasis>hosted
      mode</emphasis> using the GWT browser, which is great for debugging (from GUI to back end, the code can be stepped
      through, and changes made on the fly and simply hit refresh). There is a <filename>Guvnor.launch</filename> file
      in in the <filename>guvnor-webapp</filename> directory. To launch Guvnor in debug mode, open the Run dialog
      (<guimenu>Run</guimenu>-&gt;<guimenuitem>Run</guimenuitem>), and then choose <guimenuitem>Guvnor</guimenuitem>
      from the list. Launching this will open a new window, with Guvnor in debug mode, ready to go.</para>

      <para>Downloading and debugging Guvnor with GWT is optional, so if there are no GUI issues being worked on then
      this step can be safely skipped.</para>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Re-usable components</title>

    <para>Guvnor uses a service interface to separate the GUI from the back end functionality. In this case the back end
    both includes the asset repository (<systemitem>guvnor-repository</systemitem> and JCR) as well as the compiler
    specifics to deal with rules.</para>

    <para>The main interface is <code>RepositoryService</code>, which is implemented in
    <code>ServiceImplementation</code>. The GWT ajax front end talks to this interface using the asynchronous callback
    mechanism that GWT uses. The Seam configuration file is <filename>beans.xml</filename>. Refer to the Seam
    documentation, and the <filename>beans.xml</filename> file for details.</para>

    <para>This service interface may be re-used by alternative components or front ends.</para>

    <para>The GWT user interface may be re-used, as it is GWT is only one html page:
    <filename>Guvnor.html</filename>.</para>

    <para>Normally Guvnor is intended to be deployed as its own WAR, however it can be combined with another application
    (with some care), but it is easier to keep it as a separate WAR. We recommend deploying Guvnor by itself because
    this will make it easier to upgrade to newer releases as they come out.</para>

    <para>The <filename>Guvnor.html</filename> file can be customized. For example to change logos or embed Guvnor in
    another page. Take a look at the <filename>Guvnor.html</filename> file for details.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Versioning and Storage</title>

    <para>Refer to <xref linkend="chap-database_configuration" /> for for configuration options for database and
    filesystems.</para>

    <para>Versions of assets are stored in the database along with the data.</para>

    <para>When <emphasis>snapshots</emphasis> are created, copies are made of the entire package into a separate
    location in the JCR database.</para>

    <para>For those familiar with JCR and Apache Jackrabbit, the <filename>*.cnd</filename> files are in the source for
    the node type definitions as some wish to view these. In a nutshell, a package is a <emphasis>folder</emphasis> and
    each asset is a file: an asset can either be textual or have a binary attachment.</para>

    <title>Contributing</title>

    <para>As an open source project, contributions from the wider community are encouraged. In order to contribute
    consult the wiki and project home pages. A useful way to contribute is via logging issues or feature requests in
    JIRA. <link xlink:href="https://jira.jboss.org/jira/browse/GUVNOR">This is JIRA link to use.</link></para>
