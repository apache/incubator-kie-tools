   <title>Security - Authentication and basic access</title>

   <para>
   Please note that giving someone access to Guvnor indicates a level of trust. Being able to editing and
   build rules is providing a great deal of power to a user. Thus you should not open up Guvnor to your entire
   organization - but instead to a select few. Use https (http with TLS/SSL) where ever possible, even
   internally in a company network this is a good idea. Use this power wisely - this not a "run of the
   mill" application that provides read/write access to a database, but something much more power. Just
   imagine you are spider man - with great power comes great responsibility (of course even more so for super
   man).
   </para>

   <para>
   Security is configured by using the <filename>beans.xml</filename> file in the war file. To customize
   this, you will need to unzip the WAR file, and locate the <filename>beans.xml</filename> file which is
   in the <filename>WEB-INF</filename> directory.
   </para>

   <para>
   The JAAS standard is used as the underlying authentication and authorization mechanism, the upshot of which
   means its very flexible and able to integrate into most existing environments.
   </para>

   <para>
   Out of the box, Guvnor shows a login screen, but no security credentials are enforced - the user name is
   used, but no password check is performed. To enforce authentication, you need to configure it to use an
   appropriate user directory, you may have Active Directory or similar already.
   </para>

   <para>
   In the <filename>beans.xml</filename> file, you should located a security configuration section like
   the following:
   </para>

    <programlisting language="XML"><![CDATA[
  <security:IdentityImpl>
    <s:modifies/>

    <!-- No real authentication: demo authentication for demo purposes -->
    <security:authenticatorClass>org.drools.guvnor.server.security.DemoAuthenticator</security:authenticatorClass>

    <!-- JAAS based authentication -->
    <!--<security:authenticatorName>jaasAuthenticator</security:authenticatorName>-->

    <!-- IDM based authentication (supports LDAP, see Seam 3 and PicketLink IDM documentation) -->
    <!--<security:authenticatorClass>org.jboss.seam.security.management.IdmAuthenticator</security:authenticator>-->
  </security:IdentityImpl>]]></programlisting>

   <para>
   As you can see from above, the 2 "out of the box" options are pass through - which means any user is
   allowed in, or bypassed, in which case there is no login screen (e.g. you may be securing access to the app
   via a web server anyway).
   </para>

   <section>
      <title>Using your containers security and LDAP</title>

      <para>
      Every application server supports advanced configurations which
      can work with your existing security infrastructure. The case of JBoss
      AS will be shown here as an example.
      </para>

      <programlisting language="XML"><![CDATA[<security:identity authenticate-method="#{authenticator.authenticate}"
   jaas-config-name="other"/>]]></programlisting>

      <para>
      This will use the <literal>other</literal> JAAS config in JBoss AS. If you look in
      <filename>jboss-as/server/default/conf</filename> you will see a <filename>login-config.xml</filename>
      file. This file contains various configurations. If you use <literal>other</literal> like the one above,
      then it will look for <filename>users.properties</filename> and <filename>roles.properties</filename> in
      the <filename>conf/</filename> directory for usernames and passwords to authenticate against. This
      is maintainable only for a fixed small number of users.
      </para>

      <para>
      LDAP is perhaps the most popular choice for larger enterprises.  Here is an example that works
      with Active Directory. You can get much more information on how to configure JBoss AS for all scenarios
      with LDAP from <link xlink:href="http://wiki.jboss.org/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=LdapLoginModule">this wiki page</link>
      and <link xlink:href="http://wiki.jboss.org/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=LdapExtLoginModule">this wiki page</link>.
      </para>

      <programlisting language="XML"><![CDATA[<application-policy name="brms">
   <authentication>
      <login-module code="org.jboss.security.auth.spi.LdapExtLoginModule" flag="required" >
         <!--
            Some AD configurations may require searching against
            the Global Catalog on port 3268 instead of the usual
            port 389.  This is most likely when the AD forest
            includes multiple domains.
         -->
         <module-option name="java.naming.provider.url">ldap://ldap.jboss.org:389</module-option>
         <module-option name="bindDN">JBOSS\someadmin</module-option>
         <module-option name="bindCredential">password</module-option>
         <module-option name="baseCtxDN">cn=Users,dc=jboss,dc=org</module-option>
         <module-option name="baseFilter">(sAMAccountName={0})</module-option>

         <module-option name="rolesCtxDN">cn=Users,dc=jboss,dc=org</module-option>
         <module-option name="roleFilter">(sAMAccountName={0})</module-option>
         <module-option name="roleAttributeID">memberOf</module-option>
         <module-option name="roleAttributeIsDN">true</module-option>
         <module-option name="roleNameAttributeID">cn</module-option>

         <module-option name="roleRecursion">-1</module-option>
         <module-option name="searchScope">ONELEVEL_SCOPE</module-option>
      </login-module>
   </authentication>
</application-policy>]]></programlisting>

      <para>
      To use the above, you would put <literal>jaas-config-name="brms"</literal> in the
      <code>security:identity</code> tag in the <filename>beans.xml</filename> for Guvnor.
      </para>

      <para>
      Similar configuration examples can be found for other directory services.
      </para>

      <para>
      LDAP isn't the final word, you can use JDBC against a database of user name, or you can write your own
      login module to use any sort of weird and wonderful authentication and authorization systems that you
      may have to deal with (that would be an extreme case, but its possible). Refer to JBoss AS documentation
      (or documentation for your existing application server).
