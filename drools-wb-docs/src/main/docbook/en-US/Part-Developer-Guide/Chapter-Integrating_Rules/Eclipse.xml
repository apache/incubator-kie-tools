  <title>Eclipse Guvnor integration</title>

  <para>The Eclipse Guvnor tools (EGT) provide the ability to push/pull
  artifacts from the Guvnor repository server and the developers workspace in
  eclipse. It is therefore possible for artifacts to be both managed via
  Guvnor as well as in traditional developer friendly SCM systems (such as
  subversion). The Guvnor repository is not intended as a Source Code
  Management (SCM) solution, and the EGT are not intended to be Eclipse “team
  provider” extensions or replacements. Rather, the Guvnor repository is a
  location where certain artifacts (such as rules and SOA policy definitions)
  are controlled (“governed”) by policies defined by the deployment
  environment. The purpose of the EGT is then to enable access to resources
  held by the Guvnor repository, so they can be used in development. Thus,
  limited capabilities for reading, writing, adding, and removing Guvnor
  repository resources are provided in the EGT.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Source Code and Plug-in Details</title>

    <para>The source code for the EGT is available in <link
    xlink:href="http://github.com/droolsjbpm/droolsjbpm-tools/tree/master/drools-eclipse">github</link>.
    EGT consist of two plug-ins: org.guvnor.tools and org.eclipse.webdav. They
    require Eclipse 3.3.x. The current Eclipse Drools plug-ins are also useful
    for viewing Guvnor repository resources such as rule definitions, but not
    required for operation of the EGT.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Functionality Overview</title>

    <para>Views and Perspective: The EGT contains two views – Repository
    Explorer and Version History – that will be the center of most interaction
    with Guvnor. Eclipse standard views such as Properties and the Resource
    Navigator are also useful. While each of these views can be opened and
    positioned independently within an Eclipse workbench, the Guvnor
    perspective provides a convenient method of getting a suggested layout. In
    the Eclipse workbench menu, choose Window, Open Perspective, Other to get
    the perspective list and then choose "Guvnor Repository Exploring."</para>

    <para>On the left side is the Guvnor Repository Explorer and the Eclipse
    Properties views, the Guvnor Resource History view is on the bottom, and
    the Eclipse Resource Navigator is on the right side. The purpose of the
    Guvnor Repository Explorer is to enable access to Guvnor repository
    resources in a standard tree format, and the Guvnor Resource History view
    shows revisions of specific resources available in the repository.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Guvnor Connection Wizard</title>

    <para>After opening the Guvnor perspective, the first task is to make a
    connection to a Guvnor repository. This is handled by the Guvnor
    Connection wizard. This wizard appears in a number of places within the
    EGT (as detailed below), but in this section we will cover only the two
    most basic entry points. The Guvnor Connection wizard can be started using
    the Eclipse menu: File , New , Other , Guvnor , Guvnor repository
    location, or in the Guvnor Explorer using the drop-down menu:</para>

    <figure>

        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

    <para>or the menu button:</para>

        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>Choosing either of these will start the Guvnor connection
    wizard:</para>

    <figure>

        <imageobject>

        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>Default values appear in the Location, Port, and Repository fields.
    (See "<link linkend="section-guvnor-plugin-preferences">Guvnor plugin
    Preferences</link>" for details about how to change these default values.)
    Of course, any of these fields can be edited by typing in the
    corresponding text box. Drag-and-drop or paste into the Location field of
    a typical Guvnor repository URL such as <link
    xlink:href="&guvnor.url.base;/org.drools.guvnor.Guvnor/webdav">&guvnor.url.base;/org.drools.guvnor.Guvnor/webdav</link>
    results in the URL being parsed into the respective fields as well. The
    authentication information (user name and password) can optionally be
    stored in the Eclipse workbench's key-ring file based on the selection of
    "Save user name and password." If the authentication information is not
    stored in the key-ring, then the EGT uses session authentication, which
    means that the credentials supplied are used only for the lifetime of the
    Eclipse workbench instance.</para>

    <para>If authentication information is not stored in the key-ring or the
    authentication information (key-ring or session) is not valid, the EGT
    will prompt for authentication information when it has to access the
    Guvnor repository:</para>

    <figure>
      <title>Login</title>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata align="center" fileref="images/Chapter-Guvnor/EGT6.png"
                     format="PNG" xml:base="../../"></imagedata>
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>If authentication fails, the EGT will retry once and then issue an
    authentication failure error. (If an authentication failure error occurs,
    you can retry the same operation and supply different authentication
    information.) Note that the EGT calls the Guvnor repository at various
    times, such as when determining if resource updates are available, so, if
    you use session authentication, the authentication dialog will appear at
    different times during the Eclipse workbench session, depending on what
    actions you take. For ease of use, we recommend saving the authentication
    information in the Eclipse key-ring. (The Eclipse key-ring file is
    distinct from key-ring files found in some platforms such as Mac OS X and
    many forms of Linux. Thus, sometimes if you access a Guvnor repository
    outside the EGT, the key-ring files might become unsynchronized and you
    will be unexpectedly prompted for authentication in Eclipse. This is
    nuisance, but your usual credentials should apply in this case.)</para>

    <para>Once the Guvnor connection wizard is complete, the new Guvnor
    repository connection will appear in the Guvnor Repository Explorer. You
    can then expand the tree to view Guvnor repository contents.</para>

    <title>Guvnor Repository Explorer</title>

      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>The Guvnor Repository Explorer view contains tree structures for
    Guvnor repository contents. As described above, there are menu and
    tool-bar actions for creating Guvnor repository connections. The red “X”
    in the tool-bar and “Delete” in the menu removes a Guvnor repository
    connection, and the “Refresh” menu item reloads tree content for the
    selected node. Finally, there are a number of tool-bar/menu items in
    support of “drill-into” functionality: one the tool-bar these are
    represented by the house (“return to top level/home”) and the arrows (go
    into/back). Drill-down is useful when working with deeply nested tree
    structures and when you wish to concentrate on only branch of the tree.
    For example, drilling into the “defaultPackage” node shown above changes
    the tree view to:</para>

    <figure>
      <title>Explorer</title>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata align="center" fileref="images/Chapter-Guvnor/EGT8.png"

        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>That is, we see only the contents of “defaultPackage” in the tree.
    Clicking on the house button, or selecting “Go Home” returns the tree to
    the top-level structure shown in the previous picture above.</para>

    <para>There are a number of operations that can be performed on Guvnor
    repository files. Selecting a file in the Guvnor repository causes the
    Eclipse Properties view to update with details about that file:</para>

    <figure>
      <title>Properties</title>

        <imageobject>

        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>Double-clicking on a folder (directory) in the tree will cause that
    folder to expand if collapsed and collapse if expanded. Double-clicking on
    a file in the tree will cause a read-only editor in Eclipse to open,
    showing the contents of that file:</para>

    <figure>
      <title>Comments</title>

        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>Dragging a file from the Guvnor repository tree to a folder in an
    Eclipse local project (for example in the Eclipse Resource Navigator view)
    will cause a copy of that file to be made in the local Eclipse workspace.
    (Note: You can also “Save As...” when a file is open in a read-only editor
    to save a local writable copy of the contents. Doing so, however, will not
    associate the file created with its Guvnor source.) Finally, you can view
    the revision history of a file selected in the tree using the “Show
    History” context menu item. (The details of resource history will be
    discussed below.)</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Local Copies of Guvnor Files</title>

    <para>As mentioned in the Introduction, the main purpose of the EGT is to
    allow development using resources held in a Guvnor repository. There are
    two method of getting local copies of Guvnor repository resources:</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Drag-and-drop from the Guvnor Repository Explorer, as described
        above.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Using the “import from Guvnor” wizard, as described
        below.</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para>When local copies of Guvnor repository files are created, the EGT
    sets an association between the local copy and the master file in the
    repository. (This information is kept in the (normally) hidden
    <filename>.guvnorinfo</filename> folder in the local project and, like all
    metadata, should not be changed by end users.) This association allows for
    operations such as update and commit in synchronization with the master
    copy held in the Guvnor repository. The EGT decorates local resources
    associated with Guvnor repository master copies. This decoration appears
    in Eclipse views conforming to the Eclipse Common Navigator framework,
    such as the Eclipse Resource Navigator and the Java Package Explorer. The
    image below shows decoration in the Eclipse Resource Navigator:</para>

    <figure>
      <title>Navigator</title>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata align="center" fileref="images/Chapter-Guvnor/EGT11.png"

        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>Note the Guvnor icon decorator on the top right of the file images,
    and the Guvnor revision details appended to the file names. (The
    presence/location of these can be changed. See "<link
    linkend="section-guvnor-plugin-preferences">Guvnor plugin
    Preferences</link>" for details.) Here we see that, for example,
    <filename>simpleRule.drl</filename> is associated with a Guvnor repository
    resource and the local copy is based on revision 3, with a 7-15-2008,
    15:37:34 date/time stamp. The file <filename>deleteTest.txt</filename>,
    however, is not associated with a Guvnor repository file. Further details
    about the association can be found in the standard Eclipse properties
    page, via the context menu “Properties” selection:</para>

    <figure>
      <title>Properties</title>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>

        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>The EGT contributes a property page to the standard Eclipse
    properties dialog, the contents of which are shown above. The specific
    Guvnor repository, the location within the repository, the version
    (date/time stamp) and revision number are displayed.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Actions for Local Guvnor Resources</title>

    <para>The EGT provides a number of actions (available through the “Guvnor”
    context menu on files) for working with files, both those associated with
    Guvnor repository master copies and those not associated. The actions are:
    <code> 1.Update 2.Add 3.Commit 4.Show History 5.Compare with Version
    6.Switch to Version 7.Delete 8.Disconnect </code> Each of these actions
    will be described below.</para>

    <para>Update Action:</para>

    <para>The Update action is available for one or more Guvnor resources that
    are not in synchronization with the Guvnor repository master copies. These
    resources would not be in synchronization because either/both (1) there
    are local changes to these resources or (2) the master copies have changed
    in the Guvnor repository. Performing the Update action replaces the local
    file contents with the current contents from the Guvnor repository master
    copies (equivalent to “Switch to version” for latest version).</para>

    <para>Add Action</para>

    <para>The Add action is available for one or more local files that are not
    associated with a Guvnor repository master copy. Choosing the Add action
    launches the “Add to Guvnor” wizard:</para>

    <figure>
      <title>Add action</title>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata align="center" fileref="images/Chapter-Guvnor/EGT13.png"

        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>The first page of the wizard asks for the selection of the target
    Guvnor repository and gives the choice to create a new Guvnor repository
    connection (in which case the second page is the same as the Guvnor
    Connection wizard described above). Once the target Guvnor repository is
    chosen, the wizard then asks for the folder location to add the selection
    files:</para>

    <figure>
      <title>Add action</title>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata align="center" fileref="images/Chapter-Guvnor/EGT14.png"

        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>Here I have selected the folder “anotherPackage” as the destination
    location1. Clicking on “Finish” adds the selected files to the Guvnor
    repository and creates an association between the local and Guvnor
    repository files. (Not that the wizard will not allow for overwrite of
    existing Guvnor repository files – another target location must be
    chosen.)</para>

    <para>Compare with Version Action:</para>

    <para>The Compare with Version action is enabled for one Guvnor repository
    associated file. This action first opens a wizard asking for the version
    for comparison (with the local file contents):</para>

    <figure>
      <title>Compare</title>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata align="center" fileref="images/Chapter-Guvnor/EGT15.png"
                     format="PNG" xml:base="../../"></imagedata>
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>Once the revision is selected, the action opens the Eclipse compare
    editor (read-only):</para>

    <figure>
      <title>Compare</title>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata align="center" fileref="images/Chapter-Guvnor/EGT16.png"
                     format="PNG" xml:base="../../"></imagedata>
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>This editor uses Eclipse-standard comparison techniques to show the
    differences in the two versions. In cases where there are no differences,
    the editor will not open: rather, a dialog saying that there are no
    differences will appear.</para>

    <para>Switch to Version Action:</para>

    <para>The Switch to Version action is enabled for one Guvnor repository
    associated file. First the Switch to Version action prompts for selection
    of version:</para>

    <figure>
      <title>Versions</title>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata align="center" fileref="images/Chapter-Guvnor/EGT17.png"
                     format="PNG" xml:base="../../"></imagedata>
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>Once the version is selected, the Switch to Version action replaces
    the local file contents with those from the revision selected.</para>

    <para>Delete Action:</para>

    <para>The Delete action is enabled for one or more Guvnor repository
    associated files. After confirmation via a dialog, the Delete action
    removes the files in the Guvnor repository and deletes local metadata for
    the Guvnor repository association.</para>

    <para>Disconnect Action:</para>

    <para>The Disconnect action is enabled for one or more Guvnor repository
    associated files, and removes local metadata for the Guvnor repository
    association.</para>

    <para>Guvnor Resource History View:</para>

    <para>The Guvnor Resource History view should details about revision
    history for selected files, both local and those in Guvnor repositories.
    The initial state of this view is:</para>

    <figure>
      <title>History</title>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata align="center" fileref="images/Chapter-Guvnor/EGT18.png"
                     format="PNG" xml:base="../../"></imagedata>
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>The Guvnor Resource History view is populated by “Show History”
    actions in either the local “Guvnor” context menu or in the context menu
    for a Guvnor repository file in the Guvnor Repository Explorer. Once this
    action is performed, the Guvnor Resource History view updates to show the
    revision history:</para>

    <figure>
      <title>History</title>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata align="center" fileref="images/Chapter-Guvnor/EGT19.png"
                     format="PNG" xml:base="../../"></imagedata>
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>Here we see that the file “simpleRule.drl” has three revisions.
    Double clicking on a revision row (or context menu “Open (Read only)”)
    opens an Eclipse read-only editor with the revision contents. (Note: You
    can also “Save As...” when a file is open in a read-only editor to save a
    local writable copy of the contents. Doing so, however, will not associate
    the file created with its Guvnor source.)</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Importing Guvnor Repository Resources</title>

    <para>In addition to the single file drag-and-drop from the Guvnor
    Repository Explorer view, the EGT also includes a wizard for copying one
    or more files from a Guvnor repository to the local workspace (and setting
    the association with the Guvnor repository). This wizard is available from
    the Eclipse Import , Guvnor, Resource from Guvnor and the Eclipse File,
    New, Other, Guvnor, Resource from Guvnor menu items. (Note: the wizard is
    identical but appears in both locations to accommodate users who tend to
    view this functionality as being in either category.) The first page of
    the wizard asks for the selection of the source Guvnor repository and
    gives the choice to create a new Guvnor repository connection (in which
    case the second page is the same as the Guvnor Connection wizard described
    above).</para>

    <figure>
      <title>Import</title>

        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

    <para>On completion the wizard copies the selected files from the Guvnor

    <para>The preferences cover two categories: Guvnor repository connections
    and local Guvnor repository resource decorations.</para>

    <para>Guvnor Repository Connection Preferences</para>

    <para>There are two preferences that can be set for Guvnor repository
    connections, and these are used when creating new connections. The first
    is a default Guvnor repository URL template, which can make it easier to
    create multiple similar connections by simply changing part of the field,
    such as the host name. The second is whether saving of authentication
    information in the Eclipse platform key-ring should be enabled by default.
    As with the Guvnor repository URL template, actually whether to save a
    specific instance of authentication information in the Eclipse platform
    key-ring can be determined when actually creating the connection. That is,
    both of these preferences are simply convenience values set to reasonable
    defaults.</para>

    <para>Local Guvnor Repository Resource Decoration Preferences</para>

    <para>The second category of preferences provided by the EGT deals with
    how decoration of local resources associated with Guvnor repository
    resources is presented. Since the Guvnor repository is not a substitute
    for a SCM, and since SCM tools in Eclipse tend to decorate local
    resources, it is useful to be able to control just how the EGT decorate
    its local resources to avoid messy conflicts with SCM packages. In the
    “File Decoration” section of the preference page, you can choose the
    location (top right, bottom right, top left, bottom left) of the
    decoration icon, or you can choose not to display it. In the “Text”
    section, you can format the Guvnor metadata that is appended to the file
    names: Whether to show an indicator (&gt;) when the local file has changes
    not committed back to the Guvnor repository. Whether to show the revision
    number. Whether to show the date/time stamp. Any changes to these
    preferences take effect immediately upon clicking the “Apply” or “Ok”
    buttons.</para>
