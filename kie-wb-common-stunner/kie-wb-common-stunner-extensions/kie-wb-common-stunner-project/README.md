Stunner - Project integration modules
=====================================

These children modules provide the different assets and services to achieve the Stunner integration with the different KIE workbench commons and guvnor project API's, services, editors and screens.                     

Any Definition Set module that wants to integrate with the the KIE workbench stuff must add these modules as dependency and provide the different asset implementations required by the workbench and guvnor API's - 
An example can be found at the [Stunner BPMN project integration](../../kie-wb-common-stunner-sets/kie-wb-common-stunner-bpmn/kie-wb-common-stunner-bpmn-project/) module.
