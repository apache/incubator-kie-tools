This repository contains tooling applications and libraries for KIE projects.

## Contribute

- _Work in progress üî®_

## Build from source

> **üí° Nix development environment**: A _devbox_ configuration is provided to automatically setup all the tools above, read more in [here](./NIX_DEV_ENV.md).

To start building the Apache KIE Tools project, you're going to need:

- Node `18` _(To install, follow these instructions: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)_
- pnpm `8.7.0` _(To install, follow these instructions: https://pnpm.io/installation)_
- Maven `3.9.6`
- Java `17`
- Go `1.21.5` _(To install, follow these instructions: https://go.dev/doc/install)_
- Helm `3.13.3` _(To install, follow these instructions: https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)_

> **‚ÑπÔ∏è NOTE:** Some packages will require that `make` is available as well.

After installing the tools above, you'll need to download the dependencies and link the packages locally. Simply run:

- `pnpm bootstrap`

  > **‚ÑπÔ∏è NOTE:** If you plan on running Playwright tests, set the `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE__installDeps` environment variable to `true` before running the command above: `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE__installDeps=true pnpm bootstrap`. This will install all Playwright dependencies (such as browsers engines and OS specific libraries).

To install only the dependencies that are relevant to the package called `[pkg-name]`.

- `pnpm bootstrap -F [pkg-name]...`

  > **‚ÑπÔ∏è NOTE:** Here, `...` is actually **necessary**! They're part of a [`pnpm` filter](https://pnpm.io/filtering#--filter-package_name-1).

After dependencies are installed, you'll be able to build. To do so, you'll have two choices - `dev`, or `prod`.

Note that it is recommended that you specify which package you want to build, so replace `[pkg-name]` with the name of the desired package on one of the commands below:

- `pnpm -F [pkg-name]... build:dev` - This is fast, but not as strict. It skips tests, linters, and some type checks. Be prepared for the CI to fail on your PRs.
- `pnpm -F [pkg-name]... build:prod` - The default command to build production-ready packages. Use that to make sure your changes are correct.

> **‚ÑπÔ∏è NOTE:** Here, `...` is actually **necessary**! They're part of a [`pnpm` filter](https://pnpm.io/filtering#--filter-package_name-1).

> **‚ÑπÔ∏è NOTE:** If you want to build _everything_, run `pnpm -r build:dev` or `pnpm -r build:prod`. It's going to take a while, though :)

> **‚ÑπÔ∏è NOTE:** The Apache KIE Tools build is parameterized by several Environment Variables. For an extensive list of these variables, please see the list printed by the `bootstrap` script.

> **‚ÑπÔ∏è NOTE:** Final artifacts will be on `{packages,examples}/*/dist` directories.

## Applications

The Apache KIE Tools project contains several applications. To develop each one of them individually, refer to the instructions below.

#### VS Code Extension (DMN, BPMN, SceSim, and PMML Editors)

1. After you've successfully built the project following the instructions above, open the `packages/kie-editors-dev-vscode-extension` folder on VS Code. Use a new VS Code window so that the `packages/kie-editors-dev-vscode-extension` folder shows up as root in the VS Code explorer.
2. From there, you can Run the extension or the end-to-end tests by using the `Debug` menu/section. You can also use the respective shortcuts (F5 to start debugging, for instance).
3. **NOTE:** To run the VS Code extension in development mode, you need `webpack` and `webpack-cli` to be globally installed on NPM. Normally you can do that with `npm install -g webpack@^5.88.2 webpack-cli@^4.10.0`, but `sudo` may be required depending on your installation.
4. **Remember!** If you make changes to any package other than `packages/kie-editors-dev-vscode-extension`, you have to manually rebuild them before relaunching the extension on VS Code.

#### VS Code Extension (Serverless Workflow Editor)

1. After you've successfully built the project following the instructions above, open the `packages/serverless-workflow-vscode-extension` folder on VS Code. Use a new VS Code window so that the `packages/serverless-workflow-vscode-extension` folder shows up as root in the VS Code explorer.
1. From there, you can Run the extension or the end-to-end tests by using the `Debug` menu/section. You can also use the respective shortcuts (F5 to start debugging, for instance).
1. **Remember!** If you make changes to any package other than `packages/serverless-workflow-vscode-extension`, you have to manually rebuild them before relaunching the extension on VS Code.

#### Chrome Extension (DMN, BPMN, and SceSim Editors)

1. After you've successfully built the project following the instructions above, open the `packages/chrome-extension-pack-kogito-kie-editors` folder on your favourite IDE. You can import the entire repo as well if you want to make changes to other packages.
2. Run `pnpm build:dev` on `packages/chrome-extension-pack-kogito-kie-editors`. This will create a version of the Chrome Extension that fetches the envelope locally.
3. Open a terminal and run `pnpm start` on `packages/chrome-extension-pack-kogito-kie-editors`. This will start a `webpack serve` instance with the editors and their envelope. We use that because we don't pack the Chrome Extension bundle with the editors inside. Instead, we fetch them from GitHub pages.
4. You also have to enable invalid certificates for resources loaded from localhost in your browser. To do that, go to `chrome://flags/#temporary-unexpire-flags-m118` in your Chrome browser, enable this flag and restart browser. Then go to `chrome://flags/#allow-insecure-localhost` in your Chrome browser and enable also this flag. Alternativelly, you can go to `https://localhost:9001` and add an exception.
5. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`. Enable "Developer mode" in the top-right corner and click on "Load unpacked". Choose the `packages/chrome-extension-pack-kogito-kie-editors/dist` folder.
6. From now on you can use the development version of the extension. **Remember!** After each change, you have to rebuild the changed modules and hit the "Refresh" button of the extension card.

#### Chrome Extension (Serverless Workflow Editor)

1. After you've successfully built the project following the instructions above, open the `packages/chrome-extension-serverless-workflow-editor` folder on your favourite IDE. You can import the entire repo as well if you want to make changes to other packages.
1. Run `pnpm build:dev` on `packages/chrome-extension-serverless-workflow-editor`. This will create a version of the Chrome Extension that fetches the envelope locally.
1. Open a terminal and run `pnpm start` on `packages/chrome-extension-serverless-workflow-editor`. This will start a `webpack serve` instance with the editors and their envelope.

1. You also have to enable invalid certificates for resources loaded from localhost in your browser. To do that, go to `chrome://flags/#temporary-unexpire-flags-m118` in your Chrome browser, enable this flag and restart browser. Then go to `chrome://flags/#allow-insecure-localhost` in your Chrome browser and enable also this flag. Alternativelly, you can go to `https://localhost:9000` and add an exception.
1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`. Enable "Developer mode" in the top-right corner and click on "Load unpacked". Choose the `packages/chrome-extension-serverless-workflow-editor/dist` folder.
1. From now on you can use the development version of the extension. **Remember!** After each change, you have to rebuild the changed modules and hit the "Refresh" button of the extension card.

#### KIE Sandbox

1. After you've successfully built the project following the instructions above, go to `packages/online-editor`.
2. Open a terminal and run `pnpm start`. This will start a `webpack serve` instance with the Online Editor resources.
3. From now on you can use the development version of the Online Editor by accessing `https://localhost:9001`.
4. Run the CORS Proxy by running `pnpm start` at `packages/cors-proxy`.

#### Serverless Logic Web Tools

1. After you've successfully built the project following the instructions above, go to `packages/serverless-logic-web-tools`.
