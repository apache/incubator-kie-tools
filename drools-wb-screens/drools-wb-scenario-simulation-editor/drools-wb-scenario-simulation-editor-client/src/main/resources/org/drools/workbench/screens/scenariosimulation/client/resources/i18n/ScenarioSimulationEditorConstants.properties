ruleCheatSheet1=To start off, right-click a cell in the table and use the contextual menus to insert new columns and rows.
ruleCheatSheet2=Before defining the individual test scenarios, set the instance and field mappings for each column. Select a header cell and in the
ruleCheatSheet3=tab, choose the required field. Click
ruleCheatSheet4=Add
ruleCheatSheet5=to set the mapping.
ruleCheatSheet6=Now, define the test scenarios. Each cell of the table must contain a valid expression.
ruleCheatSheet7=In rule-based scenarios, the following expressions are supported:
ruleCheatSheet8=(or no symbol) specifies equality of a value. This is the default operator of each column and the only operator that is supported in the GIVEN section of the table.
ruleCheatSheet9=specify inequality of a value. This operator can be combined with other operators.
ruleCheatSheet10=specify a comparison: less than, greater than, less or equals than, and greater or equals than.
ruleCheatSheet11=value1, value2, value3
ruleCheatSheet12=specifies a list of values. If
ruleCheatSheet13=one or more
ruleCheatSheet14=values are valid, the scenario definition is evaluated as true.
ruleCheatSheet15=expression1; expression2; expression3
ruleCheatSheet16=specifies a list of expressions. If
ruleCheatSheet17=all
ruleCheatSheet18=expressions are valid, the scenario definition is evaluated as true.
ruleCheatSheet19=To define an empty string, use
ruleCheatSheet20=To define a null value, use
ruleCheatSheet21=An empty cell is skipped from the evaluation.
ruleCheatSheet22=Example expressions:
dmnCheatSheet1=To start off, right-click a cell in the table and use the contextual menus to modify the generated table as required.
dmnCheatSheet2=Before defining the individual test scenarios, verify the instance and field mappings for each column. If any changes are necessary, use the 
dmnCheatSheet3=tab to update the mapping.
dmnCheatSheet4=Now, define the test scenarios. Each cell of the table must contain a valid expression.
dmnCheatSheet5=Values in the GIVEN part of the table are evaluated as literal expressions, whereas values in the EXPECT section are evaluated as unary expressions. The correctness of these unary tests is verified using the results from a DMN evaluation.
dmnCheatSheet6=DMN-based scenarios use the FEEL expression language. Supported data types are:
dmnCheatSheet7=numbers
dmnCheatSheet8=strings
dmnCheatSheet9=(strings must be delimited by quotation marks), for example
dmnCheatSheet10=boolean values
dmnCheatSheet11=dates
dmnCheatSheet12=time
dmnCheatSheet13=functions
dmnCheatSheet14=contexts
dmnCheatSheet15=ranges
dmnCheatSheet16=lists
