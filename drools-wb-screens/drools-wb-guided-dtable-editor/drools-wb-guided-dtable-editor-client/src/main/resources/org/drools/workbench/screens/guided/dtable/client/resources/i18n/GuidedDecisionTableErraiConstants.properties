EditMenu.otherwiseDescription=<p>For condition columns in Guided Decision Tables, you can apply an "any other" value to table cells within the column if the following parameters are set: \
                              <ul><li><b>Calculation type</b> for the condition column has been set to <b>Literal value</b>.</li> \
                              <li><b>Operator</b> has been set as equality <b>==</b> or inequality <b>!=</b>.</li></ul> \
                              The "any other" value enables a rule to be defined for any other values not explicitly defined in the rules already in the table.</p>

AdditionalInfoPageView.HideColumn=Hide column:
AdditionalInfoPageView.LogicallyInsert=Logically insert:
AdditionalInfoPageView.UpdateEngine=Update engine with changes:
AdditionalInfoPageView.AdditionalInfoPageDescription=Add header text for the column and other supplementary parameters.
AttributeColumnPageView.Select=Select the Attribute
AttributeColumnPageView.ActivationGroup=activation-group
AttributeColumnPageView.ActivationGroupDescription=A string identifying an activation (or XOR) group to which you want to assign the rule. In activation groups, only one rule can be activated. The first rule to fire will cancel all pending activations of all rules in the activation group. Example: `activation-group "GroupName"`
AttributeColumnPageView.AgendaGroup=agenda-group
AttributeColumnPageView.AgendaGroupDescription=A string identifying an agenda group to which you want to assign the rule. Agenda groups allow you to partition the agenda to provide more execution control over groups of rules. Only rules in an agenda group that has acquired a focus are able to be activated. Example: `agenda-group "GroupName"`
AttributeColumnPageView.AutoFocus=auto-focus
AttributeColumnPageView.AutoFocusDescription=A Boolean value, applicable only to rules within agenda groups. When the option is selected, the next time the rule is activated, a focus is automatically given to the agenda group to which the rule is assigned.
AttributeColumnPageView.Calendars=calendars
AttributeColumnPageView.CalendarsDescription=A Quartz calendar definition for scheduling the rule. Example: `calendars "* * 0-7,18-23 ? * *"` (exclude non-business hours)
AttributeColumnPageView.DateEffective=date-effective
AttributeColumnPageView.DateEffectiveDescription=A string containing a date and time definition. The rule can be activated only if the current date and time is after a `date-effective` attribute. Example: `date-effective "4-Sep-2018"`
AttributeColumnPageView.DateExpires=date-expires
AttributeColumnPageView.DateExpiresDescription=A string containing a date and time definition. The rule cannot be activated if the current date and time is after the `date-expires` attribute. Example: `date-expires "4-Oct-2018"`
AttributeColumnPageView.Dialect=dialect
AttributeColumnPageView.DialectDescription=A string identifying either `JAVA` or `MVEL` as the language to be used for code expressions in the rule. By default, the rule uses the dialect specified at the package level. Any dialect specified here overrides the package dialect setting for the rule. Example: `dialect "JAVA"`
AttributeColumnPageView.Duration=duration
AttributeColumnPageView.DurationDescription=A long integer value defining the duration of time in milliseconds after which the rule can be activated, if the rule conditions are still met. Example: `duration 10000`
AttributeColumnPageView.Enabled=enabled
AttributeColumnPageView.EnabledDescription=A Boolean value. When the option is selected, the rule is enabled. When the option is not selected, the rule is disabled.
AttributeColumnPageView.LockOnActive=lock-on-active
AttributeColumnPageView.LockOnActiveDescription=A Boolean value, applicable only to rules within rule flow groups or agenda groups. When the option is selected, the next time the ruleflow group for the rule becomes active or the agenda group for the rule receives a focus, the rule cannot be activated again until the ruleflow group is no longer active or the agenda group loses the focus. This is a stronger version of the `no-loop` attribute, because the activation of a matching rule is discarded regardless of the origin of the update (not only by the rule itself). This attribute is ideal for calculation rules where you have a number of rules that modify a fact and you do not want any rule re-matching and firing again.
AttributeColumnPageView.Negate=negate
AttributeColumnPageView.NegateDescription=A Boolean value. When the option is selected, the condition (when) part of the rule is negated.
AttributeColumnPageView.NoLoop=no-loop
AttributeColumnPageView.NoLoopDescription=A Boolean value. When the option is selected, the rule cannot be reactivated (looped) if a consequence of the rule re-triggers a previously met condition. When the condition is not selected, the rule can be looped in these circumstances.
AttributeColumnPageView.RuleflowGroup=ruleflow-group
AttributeColumnPageView.RuleflowGroupDescription=A string identifying a rule flow group. In rule flow groups, rules can fire only when the group is activated by the associated rule flow. Example: `ruleflow-group "GroupName"`
AttributeColumnPageView.Salience=salience
AttributeColumnPageView.SalienceDescription=An integer defining the priority of the rule. Rules with a higher salience value are given higher priority when ordered in the activation queue. Example: `salience 10`
AttributeColumnPageView.Timer=timer
AttributeColumnPageView.TimerDescription=A string identifying either `int` (interval) or `cron` timer definition for scheduling the rule. Example: `timer "*/5 * * * *"`  (every 5 minutes)
AttributeColumnPageView.AttributeColumnPageDescription=Add one or more attribute columns representing any of the DRL rule attributes, such as Salience, Enabled, Date-Effective, and others.

FieldPageView.TextFieldPageDescription=Set the field with a predicate. \
                                       Predicates are expressions that resolve to a true or a false. \
                                       You can place $param in the field and the value from the cell will be substituted in place of param. \

                                                 portion of the rule. With this column option, you can define a Condition BRL fragment to be used in the \
                                                 left ("WHEN") side of a rule. In the embedded Guided Rule Editor, field values defined as "Template Keys" \
                                                 form columns in the decision table. Simpler column types can refer to Facts and Fact fields bound in the \
