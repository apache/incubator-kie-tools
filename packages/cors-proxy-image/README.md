# cors-proxy-image

This package contains the `Containerfile` and scripts to build a container image for the [@kie-tools/cors-proxy](https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-tools/packages/cors-proxy).

## Additional requirements

- docker

## Build

Enable the image to be built:

```bash
$ export KIE_TOOLS_BUILD__buildContainerImages=true
```

The image name, tags and port can be customized by setting the following environment variables:

```bash
$ export CORS_PROXY_IMAGE__imageRegistry=<registry>
$ export CORS_PROXY_IMAGE__imageAccount=<account>
$ export CORS_PROXY_IMAGE__imageName=<image-name>
$ export CORS_PROXY_IMAGE__imageBuildTag=<image-tag>
$ export CORS_PROXY_IMAGE__imagePort=<port>
$ export CORS_PROXY_IMAGE__imageOrigin=<origin>
$ export CORS_PROXY_IMAGE__imageVerbose=<verbose>
```

Default values can be found [here](./env/index.js).

After setting up the environment variables, run the following in the root folder of the repository to build the package:

```bash
$ pnpm @kie-tools/cors-proxy-image... build:prod
```

Then check out the image:

```bash
$ docker images
```

## Run

Start up a new container with:

```bash
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 -i --rm docker.io/apache/incubator-kie-cors-proxy:latest
```

The service will be up at http://localhost:8080

Apache KIE (incubating) is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software
Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the name of Apache Incubator. Incubation is
required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that
the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized
in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation
status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the
code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.

Some of the incubating projectâ€™s releases may not be fully compliant with ASF
policy. For example, releases may have incomplete or un-reviewed licensing
conditions. What follows is a list of known issues the project is currently
aware of (note that this list, by definition, is likely to be incomplete):

- Hibernate, an LGPL project, is being used. Hibernate is in the process of
  relicensing to ASL v2
- Some files, particularly test files, and those not supporting comments, may
  be missing the ASF Licensing Header

If you are planning to incorporate this work into your product/project, please
be aware that you will need to conduct a thorough licensing review to determine
the overall implications of including this work. For the current status of this
