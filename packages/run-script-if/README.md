CLI tool to help executing shell scripts conditionally with a friendly syntax on
Linux, macOS, and Windows.


__NOTE FOR WINDOWS USAGE__:
Because 'run-script-if' was created with pnpm/Yarn/NPM scripts, environment
variables and Command Substitution syntax (`$(expr)`) in mind, 'run-script-if'
will force the provided commands to be executed on PowerShell.

This is because pnpm, Yarn, and NPM default to the CMD shell on Windows, making
it not ideal for Command Substitution-dependent commands.

Apart from using it on commands, it's also possible to use the Command
Substitution syntax on boolean conditions, like:

$ run-script-if --bool "$(my-custom-command --isEnabled)" --then "echo 'Hello'"
```
