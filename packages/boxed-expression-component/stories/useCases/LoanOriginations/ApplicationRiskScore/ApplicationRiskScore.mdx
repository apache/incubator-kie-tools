The **Application risk score** decision is a
[Boxed Context](/docs/boxed-expressions-context--overview) expression.
It has three context entries with [Boxed Literal](/docs/boxed-expressions-literal--overview)
expressions, with the purpose of saving the desired
properties to be used on the result expression. Those values are the applicant's
"Age", "Marital Status" and "Employment Status". The result expression is a
[Decision Table](/docs/boxed-expressions-decision-table--overview) with
the _Collect_ Hit Policy and the _Sum_ aggregation,
meaning that all matched rules will be summed and returned.
