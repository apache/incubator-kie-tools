The **Eligibility** decision is a
[Decision Table](/docs/boxed-expressions-decision-table--overview) expression with the
_First_ Hit Policy. This [Decision Table](/docs/boxed-expressions-decision-table--overview)
creates rules based on the applicant's "Age" and the results of the
"[Pre-bureau affordability](/docs/use-cases-loan-originations-bureau-strategy-decision-service-pre-bureau-affordability--overview)"
and "[Pre-bureau risk category](/docs/use-cases-loan-originations-bureau-strategy-decision-service-pre-bureau-risk-category--overview)" decisions.
The result is if the applicant is "Ineligible" or "Eligible" for the requested loan.
