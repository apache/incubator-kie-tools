The **Pre-bureau risk category** decision is a
[Boxed Context](/docs/boxed-expressions-context--overview) expression.
It has one context entries with [Boxed Literal](/docs/boxed-expressions-literal--overview)
expressions called "Existing Customer", which saves if the applicant is a previous customer.
The result expression is a
[Decision Table](/docs/boxed-expressions-decision-table--overview) with
the _Unique_ Hit Policy, which uses the "Existing Customer", and
"[Application risk score](/docs/use-cases-loan-originations-application-risk-score--overview)"
to create rules. This [Decision Table](/docs/boxed-expressions-decision-table--overview)
is a complete table with all possible combinations.
