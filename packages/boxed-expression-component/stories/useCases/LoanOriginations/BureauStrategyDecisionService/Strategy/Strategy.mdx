The **Strategy** decision is a
[Decision Table](/docs/boxed-expressions-decision-table--overview) expression with the
_Unique_ Hit Policy. This [Decision Table](/docs/boxed-expressions-decision-table--overview)
creates rules with the results of the
"[Bureau call type](/docs/use-cases-loan-originations-bureau-strategy-decision-service-bureau-call-type--overview)"
and "[Eligibility](/docs/use-cases-loan-originations-bureau-strategy-decision-service-eligibility--overview)" decisions.
The result is which strategy the office should follow for the applicant. The office can "Decline" the loan, pass "Through"
the next steps, or collect more data from the "Bureau" office.
