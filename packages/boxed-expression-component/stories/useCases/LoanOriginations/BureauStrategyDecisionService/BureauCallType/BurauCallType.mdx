The **Bureau call type** decision is a
[Decision Table](/docs/boxed-expressions-decision-table--overview) expression with the
_Unique_ Hit Policy. This [Decision Table](/docs/boxed-expressions-decision-table--overview)
creates rules with the result of the
"[Pre-bureau risk category](/docs/use-cases-loan-originations-bureau-strategy-decision-service-pre-bureau-risk-category--overview)" decision.
The result is how much data should be requested from the credit bureau for this application. It can be "Full", meaning all information
available. It can be "Mini", meaning a minimal amount of data. Finally, "None" if no data is needed.
