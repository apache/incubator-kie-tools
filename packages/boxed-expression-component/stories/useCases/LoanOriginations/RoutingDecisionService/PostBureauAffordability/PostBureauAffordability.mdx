The **Post-bureau affordability** decision is a
[Boxed Invocation](/docs/boxed-expressions-invocation--overview) expression.
It invokes the [Afforadability calculation](/docs/use-cases-loan-originations-functions-affordability-calculation--overview)
function passing the five required parameters. All five parameters are
[Boxed Literal](/docs/boxed-expressions-literal--overview) expressions. The first three have the purpose
of saving the applicant's data. The last two passes down the results of the
[Post-bureau risk category](/docs/use-cases-loan-originations-routing-decision-service-post-bureau-risk-category--overview)
and [Required monthly installment](/docs/use-cases-loan-originations-required-monthly-installment--overview)
decisions.
