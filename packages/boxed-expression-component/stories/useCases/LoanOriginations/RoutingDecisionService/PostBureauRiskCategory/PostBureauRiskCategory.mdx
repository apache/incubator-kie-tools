The **Post-bureau risk category** decision is a
[Boxed Context](/docs/boxed-expressions-context--overview) expression.
It has two context entries with [Boxed Literal](/docs/boxed-expressions-literal--overview)
expressions. The first entry, "Existing Customer", saves if the applicant is a previous customer.
The second entry, "Credit Score", saves the credit score value that comes from the bureau office.
The result expression is a
[Decision Table](/docs/boxed-expressions-decision-table--overview) with
the _Unique_ Hit Policy, which uses the "Existing Customer", "Credit Score", and
"[Application risk score](/docs/use-cases-loan-originations-application-risk-score--overview)"
to create rules. This [Decision Table](/docs/boxed-expressions-decision-table--overview)
is a complete table with all possible combinations.
