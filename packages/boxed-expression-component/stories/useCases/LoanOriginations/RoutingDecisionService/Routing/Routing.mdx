<Meta title="Use cases/Loan Originations/Routing Decision Service/Routing" />

The **Routing** decision is a
[Boxed Context](/docs/boxed-expressions-context--overview) expression.
It has two context entries with [Boxed Literal](/docs/boxed-expressions-literal--overview)
expressions. The first entry, "Bankrupt", saves if the applicant is bankrupted.
The second entry, "Credit Score", saves the credit score value that comes from the bureau office.
The result expression is a
[Decision Table](/docs/boxed-expressions-decision-table--overview) with
the _Priority_ Hit Policy, which uses the "Bankrupt", "Credit Score",
"[Post-bureau affordability](/docs/use-cases-loan-originations-application-risk-score--overview)", and
"[Post-bureau risk category](/docs/use-cases-loan-originations-application-risk-score--overview)"
to create rules. The [Decision Table](/docs/boxed-expressions-decision-table--overview) result determines
if the applicant loan will be declined ("Decline"), accepted ("Accept"), or manually revised ("Refer").
The priority is set, in order, to "Decline", "Refer", and "Accept".
