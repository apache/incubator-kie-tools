The **Affordability Calculation** Business Knowledge Model is a
[Boxed Function](/docs/boxed-expressions-function--overview) expression.
It has five parameters," Monthly Income", "Monthly Repayments", "Monthly Expenses",
"Risk Category", and "Required Monthly Installment". The function contains a
[Boxed Context](/docs/boxed-expressions-context--overview) on
its body with two entries. The "Disposable Income" entry is a [Boxed Literal](/docs/boxed-expressions-literal--overview)
which makes a calculation based on the monthly "Income", "Repayments"
and "Expenses". The "Credit Contingency Factor" entry has a
[Decision Table](/docs/boxed-expressions-decision-table--overview), which returns
the "Credit Contingency Factor" value based on the "Risk Category".
The result of the [Boxed Context](/docs/boxed-expressions-context--overview),
which is the return of the [Boxed Function](/docs/boxed-expressions-function--overview),
returns a boolean value based on the "Disposable Income", "Credit Contingency Factor"
and "Required Monthly Installment".
