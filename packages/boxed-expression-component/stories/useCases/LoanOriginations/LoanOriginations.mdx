# Loan Originations Example

## Overview

The loan origination process is an example that was picked from the [DMN 1.4 Spec](https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN/1.4/Beta1/PDF#page=180).
This example brings decisions with a big variety of boxed expressions. The loan origination process can be modeled in a BPMN as follows:

</p>

A summary of the loan origination process:

First, is collected the application data. The application data is used as input for the "Decide Bureau strategy"
which uses the [Bureau Strategy Decision Service](/docs/use-cases-loan-originations-bureau-strategy-decision-service-overview--overview) DRD.
This Decision Service will output which strategy should be used:

- Bureau: collect bureau data before proceeding;
- Through: approve for the next steps;
- Decline: decline the application and end the process;

After collecting bureau data, if required, all the information is passed to the
[Routing Decision Service](/docs/use-cases-loan-originations-routing-decision-service-overview--overview) DRD. Now, this Decision Service will:

- Accept: Accept the application and end the process;
- Decline: decline the application and end the process;
- Refer: manually review the application;

In case the application should be manually reviewed, supporting documents are required to be reviewed by a credit officer,
which can accept or decline the application.
