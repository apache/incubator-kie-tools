## Find Employees

This example brings an employee finder by knowledge and department. The following DRD brings two input nodes "Knowledge"
and "Dept" (Department) that will be used for the search. It also contains two decision nodes, one with the employee's
information, called "Employees", and one "Find by Employees" responsible for invoking the function "Find an employee by knowledge"
on the Business Knowledge Model node.

</p>

It was created some data types for this DMN model. The "tEmployee" data type contains
all relevant information about the employee, such as "Id", "Knowledges", "Dept" and "Name".
The "Knowledges" is of the type "tKnowledges", which is a list of "tKnowledge". It can have
the values "Git", "Java", "Scrum", and "TypeScript".
The "Dept" is from the type "tDept", which is an enumeration with the "Sales", "Engineering"
and "Management" values.

## Boxed expressions

The decision logic of the DRG was divided as follow:

### Employees

---

This decision node contains all Employee's information. For this, it's used the
[Relation](/docs/boxed-expressions-relation--overview) expression, which enables
to creation of a column for each Employee property. The Employee contains "Id", "Name", "Dept"
(Department) and the employee's "Knowledges". The " Knowledges" is a List of Knowledge.

### Find employee by knowledge

---

The Business Knowledge Model **Find employees by knowledge** contains a
[Boxed Function](/docs/boxed-expressions-function--overview) expression. This function has
received three parameters: "employees", "knowledge" and "dept" and returns a list of employees that met the knowledge
and department requirements. The [Boxed Function](/docs/boxed-expressions-function--overview) has a
[Boxed Context](/docs/boxed-expressions-context--overview) on its body. The first context entry has a
[Boxed Literal](/docs/boxed-expressions-literal--overview), and is responsible
for filtering the Employees list by department and saving the value as **Employees by Dept**.
The second context entry **Employees with Knowledge** also has a
[Boxed Literal](/docs/boxed-expressions-literal--overview) and checks the required knowledge on all employees,
the ones that know are returned, otherwise returns null. Finally, on the context results, we have a
a [Boxed Literal](/docs/boxed-expressions-literal--overview) which filters the null values from **Employees with Knowledge**

### Find by Employees

---

The **Find by Employees** decision invokes the **Find employees by knowledge** function using a
[Boxed Invocation](/docs/boxed-expressions-invocation--overview).
The "Knowledge" and "Dept" come from input nodes, and "Employees" comes from the **Employees** decision node.
