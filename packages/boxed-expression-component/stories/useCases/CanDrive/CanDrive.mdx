## Can drive?

**Can drive?** is a simple example of a decision that checks if the person can drive in specific country
or not. It uses a "Person" input and a "Can drive?" decision.

It was created a tPerson data type which is a structure with "Country" and "Age" values. The country is a enumeration
with three possible values: "Brazil", "US", "England".

## Boxed Expression

The **Can drive?** decision uses a [Decision Table](/docs/boxed-expressions-decision-table--overview) expression with all possible values, and therefore a Unique
Hit Policy. It checks the combination of the Person Age and Country to dictate if the Person can drive or
not on its Country.
