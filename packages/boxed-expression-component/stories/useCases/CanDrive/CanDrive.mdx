## Can drive?

**Can drive?** is a simple example of a decision that checks if a person can drive in a specific country.
It uses a "Person" input and a "Can drive?" decision.

For this DMN, a "tPerson" data type was created. It is a structure with "Country" and "Age" values. The country is an enumeration
with three possible values: "Brazil", "US", and "England".

## Boxed Expression

The **Can drive?** decision uses a [Decision Table](/docs/boxed-expressions-decision-table--overview)
expression with all possible values, and therefore a **Unique**
Hit Policy. It checks the combination of the Person's Age and Country to dictate if the Person can drive or
not in its Country.
