# Boxed List

A Boxed List expression enables to create a vertical list of boxed expressions.
Each row starts with the row index and has an boxed expression item associated with it.
It's possible to create any type of boxed expresison for each item, even nested lists [1].

<div style={{ display: "flex", flexDirection: "row" }}>
  <Story of={List.List} />
  <small>
    <br />
    <br />
    This is a example of a Boxed List expression for an Age group decision which has the "number" type. In this Boxed
    List each row is a Boxed Literal and on each one of these Boxed Literal we have four different number ranges.
