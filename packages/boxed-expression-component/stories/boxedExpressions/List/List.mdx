# Boxed List

A Boxed List expression enables to creation of a vertical list of boxed expressions.
Each row starts with the row index and has a boxed expression item associated with it.
It's possible to create any type of boxed expression for each item, even nested lists [1].

<div style={{ display: "flex", flexDirection: "row" }}>
  <Story of={List.AgeGroups} />
  <small>
    <br />
    <br />
    This is an example of a Boxed List expression for an Age group decision that has the "number" type. In this Boxed
    List each row is a Boxed Literal and on each one of these Boxed Literal, we have four different number ranges.

</div>

## Items columns

### Header

The header of the Boxed List expression will only exist if it's the root expression
of a decision node, and the header will represent the decision name and type.
Right-clicking on it, a context menu will open enabling you to edit its values.

### Items

The items can be any type of boxed expression, even other Boxed List. By default, a Boxed Literal expression will be placed
on the first item, and it's possible to reset the expression by Left clicking on it, and clicking on "Reset".

or on the bottom (insert below) of the cell, the position of the plus sign will depend on the mouse position.
