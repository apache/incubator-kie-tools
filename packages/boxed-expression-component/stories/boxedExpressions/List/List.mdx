2. First row:
   1. First column: it has a "#" symbol which is a placeholder;
   2. Second column: it has the expression name and its type. By clicking on it you can edit its name and type;
3. Second row:
   1. First column: it has the "1" number which represents the row number;
   1. Second column: it's where the expression of the first row is placed. This expression can be any other expression a nested list is included.
