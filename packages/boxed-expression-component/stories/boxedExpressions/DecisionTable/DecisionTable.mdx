# Decision Table

The Decision Table expression creates a table of business rules. For each row, the
combination of the input columns creates a rule. These rules can have one or multiple
outputs, which are defined by the output column. The Decision Table should contain only
the inputs required to determine the output [1]. It's also possible to achieve
different results with the same rules by tweaking the Decision Table **Hit Policy**.
The Hit Policy is a way of changing how the Decision Table outputs should be considered.

<div style={{ display: "flex", flexDirection: "row" }}>
  <Story of={DecisionTable.Discount} />
  <small>
    <br />
    This is an example of a "Discount" decision with the "number" type. It has a Decision Table with one input column "Customer.Category"
    with "tCategory" type. The "Customer" can have multiple categories. The output column "Discount" has the "number" type.
    The "Annotations" column is empty, but it could be used to create useful annotations for each rule. The Decision Table
    has the **Priority** Hit Policy meaning that has a priority order to match a rule. If a "Customer" is a "Student" and
    a "New Client", the customer should receive 30% of discount. The priority is determined by the DRG.

</div>

## Hit Policy

The Decision Table Hit Policy determines how to evaluate the Decision Table rules or
how the outputs should be considered. By right-clicking in the Hit Policy cell, which
is the top left corner cell, it's possible to tweak the Decision Table Hit Policy.

### Unique (U)

The **Unique** Hit Policy dictates that there shouldn't be overlapping rules, therefore
just one rule should be matched. If more than one rule is matched the result is
undefined.

### First (F)

The **First** Hit Policy will return the first matched rule, halting the evaluation
further evaluation. This type of Hit Policy isn't considered a good practice as they
do not offer a clear overview of the decision logic [2].

### Priority (P)

The **Priority** Hit Policy can match multiple rules but will return the highest
output priority. The priorities are determined by the list of output values in order
and are independent of rule order. For example: an output that can assume the values
"Accept" and "Decline", the "Accept" value has the priority. On the other hand, if the
output can assume the values "Decline" and "Accept" the "Decline" value has priority.

### Any (A)

The **Any** Hit Policy can match multiple rules, but all matching rules should have
equal output entries. This process ignores annotations and any match can be
used. If all output entries from the matched rule are non-equal, the result is undefined.

### Collect (C)

The **Collect** Hit Policy will return all matched rules in arbitrary order. A
function can be applied to the outputs before it is returned. By default no function
is used, thus the addition of the **?** symbol.

**Important**: These functions can't be used by Decision Tables with more
than one output column.

> #### Aggregation Function (+, #, \<, >)
>
> - **Sum(+)**: returns the sum of all matched outputs. It only works for number outputs.
> - **Count(#)**: returns the count of matched outputs.
> - **Max (>)**: returns the largest value of all matched outputs. It only works for number,
>   date, text (lexicographic order).
> - **Min (\<)**: returns the lowest value of all matched outputs. It only works for number,
>   date, text (lexicographic order).

### Rule Order (R)

The **Rule Order** Hit Policy will return all matched rules in order. The order is
determined by the sequence of rules.

### Output Order (O)

The **Output Order** Hit Policy will return all matched rules in decreasing
priority order. The priorities are determined by the list of output values and are
independent of rule order. Read more about Priority in the **Priority** Hit Policy.

## Inputs

In the Decision Table expression, the input columns have names and types, and all of them
should be used during the rule evaluation. In the input cells, a dash symbol ("-") can
be used to mean any input value. For example, when the input is irrelevant to the
containing rule. An empty cell means the input should have an empty value.

### Curiosities

- Tables containing at least one "-" input entry are called contracted tables. The others are called expanded.
- Tables where every input entry is true, false, or "-" are historically called limited-entry tables.
- A complete Decision Table contains all possible combinations of input values

## Outputs

In the Decision Table expression, the output columns have the return value for each rule
and in the output header its name and type.
If the Decision Table is the root expression of a decision node, the header row
_can_ be split into two rows. It will only be split if the Decision Table has more
than one output column. In this case, the first row will represent the decision name
and type, and the second will represent the output name and type. On the contrary,
if the Decision Table has only one output column, it will have the same name and type
as its decision. Now, if the Decision Table is a nested expression, it will have
only one row, which will be the output's name and type.

> ### Decision header
>
> This row will be a single cell that has the decision name and its type, and by right-clicking on it a
> context menu will open enabling you to edit its values.
>
> ### Outputs header
>
> This row has a cell for each output name and type, and right-clicking on a context menu will
> open enabling it to edit its values.

## Annotations

In the Decision Table expression, the annotation column is used to provide additional
and helpful information about each one of the rules. These annotations are not used
during the rule evaluation.

## Rules

In the Decision Table expression on each row, the combination of input columns creates
a rule. The rule evaluation does not produce side effects that influence the evaluation
of other rules in the same Decisio Table. This is particularly important in first
hit tables where the rules are evaluated in a predefined sequence.

## Controls

### Rows

Left-clicking on the index column cells or in the value cells will open the "Rows" context menu.
It's possible to insert above, insert below, insert multiples, delete, and duplicate the row.

Another way to add rows is by hovering the mouse on the index column cells will make appear a plus sign on the top (insert above)
or on the bottom (insert below) of the cell, the position of the plus sign will depend on the mouse position.
Right-clicking on it will add a new row above or below the actual row.

**Important**: It's not possible to perform the above process in the header row index ("#").

### Header

Left-clicking on the header cells or in the value cells will open the "Columns" context menu.
It's possible to insert left, insert right, insert multiples, and delete the column.

Another way to add columns is by hovering the mouse on a variable cell will make appear a plus sign on the right (insert right)
or left (insert left) side of the cell, the position of the plus sign will depend on the mouse position.
Right-clicking on it will add a new column on the right or left side of the actual column.
