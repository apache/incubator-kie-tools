<Meta title="MDX/Literal" of={Literal} />

The Boxed Literal expression was implemented as a boxed FEEL expression, which is defined by the FEEL grammar.
This expression has access to the scope context derived from the DRD [1].

<div style={{ display: "flex", flexDirection: "row" }}>
  <Story of={Literal.CanDrive} />
  <small>
    This is an example of a Boxed Literal expression for a "Can Drive?" decision which has the boolean type. The "Age"
    derives from the DRD, and it comes from another decision or input. The expression uses the FEEL grammar to return a
    "true" value when the "Age" is above or equal to 18 and on the opposite side, it returns "false" when "Age" is below
    18.
  </small>
</div>

## Header

The header of the boxed FEEL expression will only exist if it's the root expression of a decision node,
and the header will represent the decision name and type. Right-clicking on it a context menu will open enabling you to edit its values.

## Value

The FEEL expression has the DRD scope.

## Examples

<div style={{ display: "flex", flexDirection: "column" }}>
  <div style={{ display: "flex", flexDirection: "row" }}>
    <Story of={Literal.Base} />
    <small>
      <br />
      <br />
      An empty Boxed Literal expression.
    </small>
  </div>

  <div style={{ display: "flex", flexDirection: "row" }}>
    <Story of={Literal.Nested} />
    <small>
      <br />
      <br />
      An empty Boxed Literal expression nested on a Boxed Context expression.
    </small>
