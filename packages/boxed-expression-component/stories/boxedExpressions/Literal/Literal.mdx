# Boxed FEEL expression

The Boxed Literal expression was implemented as a boxed FEEL expression and it's defined by the FEEL grammar
and has access to the scope context derived from the DRD [1].

<div style={{ display: "flex", flexDirection: "row" }}>
  <Story of={Literal.CanDrive} />
  <small>
    This is a example of a Boxed Literal expression for a "Can Drive?" decision which has the boolean type. The "Age"
    derives from the DRD, and it comes from another decision or input. The expression uses the FEEL grammar to return a
    "true" value when the "Age" is above or equal 18 and on the opposite side, it returns "false" when "Age" is below
    18.

</div>

## Header

The header of the boxed FEEL expression will only exist if it's the root expression of a decision node,
and the header will represets the decision name and type. Right clicking on it a context menu will open enabling to edit its values.

## Value

The FEEL expression that has the DRD scope.

## Examples
