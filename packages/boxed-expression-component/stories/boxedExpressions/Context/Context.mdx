# Boxed Context

A boxed context is a collection of n (name, value) pairs with an optional result value.
The names SHALL be distinct within a context. Each pair is called a context entry.
The intent is that all the entries of a context should be easily identified by looking down the left edge of a vertical
context or across the top edge of a horizontal context.
