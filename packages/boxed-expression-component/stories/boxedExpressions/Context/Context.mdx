# Boxed Context

A Boxed Context is a set of name-value pairs. Each one of these pairs is called a context entry. The Boxed Context has an optional result value
and if the intent is to return the context entries the result should be left empty. The Boxed Context values and the result can be any type of boxed
expression, even nested Boxed Contexts [1].

<div style={{ display: "flex", flexDirection: "row" }}>
  <Story of={Context.InstallmentCalculation} />
  <small>
    <br />
    <br />
    This is an example of an "Installment calculation" decision with the "number" type. It has a Boxed Context
    expression with two context entries "Fee" with a Boxed Literal containing the value "25", and "Repayments" with
    Boxed Literal containing a FEEL expression using values from the decision context, such as "Amount", "Rate" and
    "Term". This Boxed Context has a result, which is the sum of both context entries.
  </small>
</div>

<div style={{ display: "flex", flexDirection: "row" }}>
  <Story of={Context.Customer} />
  <small>
    <br />
    <br />
    This is an example of a "Customer" decision with the "tCustomer" type. It has a Boxed Context expression with two
    context entries "Name" with a Boxed Literal containing the value "Luiz", and "Age", with another Boxed Literal
    containing the value "30". This Boxed Context doesn't have a result, therefore it will return a context with two
    properties: "Name" and "Age".
  </small>
</div>

## Header

If the Boxed Context is the root expression of a decision node, the Boxed Context will have one
header row, which represents the decision name and type.
Right-clicking on it a context menu will open enabling you to edit its values.

## Context Entries

The context entries rows can't be less than one and don't have a maximum number. Each context entry has a name, and type and has
a boxed expression associated with it. Right-clicking on the parameter name opens a context menu, enabling to edit its
name and type.

## Result

The result can't be less than one and doesn't have a maximum number. Each parameter has a name and type and has
a boxed expression associated with it. Right-clicking on the parameter name opens a context menu, enabling to edit its
name and type.

**Important**: It's not possible to have a parameterless function.

## Controls

### Context Entries

Left-clicking on a context entry cell will open the "Rows" context menu.
It's possible to insert above, insert below, insert multiples, delete, and reset the context entry.

Another way to add context entries is by hovering the mouse on a context entry cell, which will
make appear a plus sign on the top (insert above) or on the bottom (insert below) of the cell,
the position of the plus sign will depend of the mouse position. Right-clicking on it will add
a new context entry above or below the actual context entry.

## Examples

<div style={{ display: "flex", flexDirection: "column" }}>
  <div style={{ display: "flex", flexDirection: "row" }}>
    <Story of={Context.Base} />
    <small>
      <br />
      <br />
      An empty Boxed Context expression.
    </small>
  </div>

  <div style={{ display: "flex", flexDirection: "row" }}>
    <Story of={Context.Nested} />
    <small>
      <br />
      <br />
      An empty Boxed Context expression nested on a Boxed Context expression.
