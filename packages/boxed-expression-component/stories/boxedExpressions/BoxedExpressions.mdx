# Boxed Expressions

A boxed expression in DMN is defined as a graphical notation for all decision logic. This notation is
used to decompose the decision logic into small pieces that can be associated with the DRG artifacts.
The combination of the DRG with the boxed expressions forms a complete and mostly graphical language [1].

The boxed expressions are defined recursively, meaning that some boxed expressions can contain another
boxed expression. The top level of a boxed expression corresponds to the decision logic of a single DRG artifact,
and this boxed expression will have a header with the DRG artifact name and type.

Currently, the following boxed expressions are supported:

- [Context](/docs/boxed-expressions-context--overview)
- [Decision Table](/docs/boxed-expressions-decision-table--overview)
- [Function](/docs/boxed-expressions-function--overview)
- [Invocation](/boxed-expressions-invocation--overview)
- [List](/docs/boxed-expressions-list--overview)
- [Literal](/docs/boxed-expressions-literal--overview)
- [Relation](/docs/boxed-expressions-relation--overview)
