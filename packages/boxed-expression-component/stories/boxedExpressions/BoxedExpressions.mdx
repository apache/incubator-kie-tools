# Boxed Expressions

## What is a Boxed Expression?

We define a graphical notation for decision logic called boxed expressions. This notation serves to decompose the
decision logic model into small pieces that can be associated with DRG artifacts. The DRD plus the boxed
expressions form a complete, mostly graphical language that completely specifies Decision Models

#### Selection context menu

The "Selection" context menu is available on all cells. It gives the option of "Copy", "Cut", "Paste", "Reset"

##### Resizing

Hovering the mouse on the header or item cell will show a resize handle on the right side of the cell.
Clicking on it and draging enables to resize the cell to the minimum of 190px and without a maximum size.

**Important**: This action is only possible if an item has an expression, and this operation will resize all cells in the column.
