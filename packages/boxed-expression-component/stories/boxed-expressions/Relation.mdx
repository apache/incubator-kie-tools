# Relation Boxed Expression

A Relation Expression is a vertical list of horizontal values (with no result cells) with the variable names appearing just once at the top of the list, like a relational table.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Relation.Base} />
</Canvas>

For example, the following Relation Expression provides customers profiles:

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Relation.CustomerProfiles} />
</Canvas>
