# Standalone table

A standalone table is the base component for all boxed expressions. This component
makes it possible to create your own customizable table with many tweak options and helper functions.

The following example is a customizable table with one row and one column.

<Canvas style={{ border: "unset", boxShadow: "unset" }}>
  <Story of={StandaloneTable.Base} />
</Canvas>

The following example is a customizable table with one "People" column with three sub columns
"Name", "Age" and "Country".

<Canvas style={{ border: "unset", boxShadow: "unset" }}>
  <Story of={StandaloneTable.People} />
</Canvas>
