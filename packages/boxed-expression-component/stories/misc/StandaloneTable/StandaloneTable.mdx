# Standalone table

Another way to use the boxed expression component is by using the Standalone table. This component
makes it possible to create your own customizable table with many tweak options and helper functions.

The following example is a customizable table with one row and one column.

<Canvas style={{ border: "unset", boxShadow: "unset" }}>
  <Story of={StandaloneTable.Base} />
</Canvas>

The following example is a customizable table with one "People" column with three sub columns
"Name", "Age" and "Country", and an aditional index column.

<Canvas style={{ border: "unset", boxShadow: "unset" }}>
  <Story of={StandaloneTable.People} />
</Canvas>
