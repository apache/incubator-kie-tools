# Empty Expression

An Empty Boxed expression is the first step for a decision node. It is also what is shown in expressions
that uses nested expressions, such as the Boxed Context, Boxed Function, Boxed Invocation, and Boxed List.

The Empty Boxed expression gives the option to create a new Boxed expression by right-clicking on it. If we're
creating a new decision logic for a decision node, it will show as follows:

- Literal ([Boxed Literal](/docs/boxed-expressions-literal--overview))
- Context ([Boxed Context](/docs/boxed-expressions-context--overview))
- [Decision table](/docs/boxed-expressions-decision-table--overview)
- [Relation](/docs/boxed-expressions-relation--overview)
- Invocation ([Boxed Invocation](/docs/boxed-expressions-invocation--overview))
- List ([Boxed List](/docs/boxed-expressions-list--overview))
- Paste ([Selection context](/docs/features-selection--overview))

**Important**: The option for creating a [Boxed Function](/docs/boxed-expressions-function--overview) will only appear on a nested expression.
