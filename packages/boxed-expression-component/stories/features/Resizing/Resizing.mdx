# Resizing

The boxed expression component gives the possibility to resize almost every cell in a column.
The resize operation recursively affects all nested expressions in the same column
keeping the resize operation consistent.

To perform a resize operation, the column should have a entry or a expression on it. It's not possible
to resize index cells, or a column with only empty expressions.

To perform the resize operation hover the mouse on a cell of the desired column.
A resize handle on the right side of the cell will appear. Right clicking on it and draging
will resize the cell. The minimum depends of the expression or column, and it does not have a maxium width.

<div style={{ display: "flex", flexDirection: "row" }}>
  <Story of={Resizing.CanDrive} />

    This example brings a Boxed Literal expression with the 500px width.

</div>

On nested expressions the default minimal size of a column will be changed accordlying to the
minimal size of the expression. e.g. a nested decision table can't have a minor size than
the sum of the minimal size of its columns.

# Reset

To reset the size of a column hover the mouse on a cell of the column.
The resize handle on the right side of the cell will appear. Double right clicking on it will
reset the column size to the default value. It's important to notice that the default size
can vary depending of nested expressions.
