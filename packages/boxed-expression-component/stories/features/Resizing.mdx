# Resizing

The boxed expression component gives the possibility to resize almost every cell in a column.
The resize operation recursively affects all nested expressions in the same column
keeping the resize operation consistent.

To perform a resize operation, the column should have a entry or a expression on it. It's not possible
to resize index cells, or a column with only empty expressions.

To resize, hover the mouse on a cell of the desired column. A resize handle on the right side of the cell
will appear. Right clicking on it and draging will resize the cell. The minimum depends of the column,
and it does not have a maxium width.
