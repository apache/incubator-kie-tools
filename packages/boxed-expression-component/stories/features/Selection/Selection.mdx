## Copy

### Expression

  "id":"_D334D2A9-4312-479F-8F45-A3D4AF2C4AFC",
  "name":"Can Drive?",
  "dataType":"boolean",
  "logicType":"Literal",

  "width":320
}
`}
/>

headers and indexes columns.

Select expression menu.

  "dataType":"<Undefined>",
  "logicType":"List",
  "items":[
    {

## Cut

The cut operation operates the same way as the "Copy" command, with the difference that it will
also reset the expression or the cell current value. Therefore, it's not possible to perform
cut operations on headers and index cells.

## Reset

The reset operation resets the expression or the cell current value. Therefore, it's not possible to perform
reset operations on headers and index cells.
