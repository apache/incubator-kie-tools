# Invocation Expression

The syntax for boxed invocation is described in clause 7.2.3. This syntax may be used to invoke any function
(e.g., business knowledge model, FEEL built-in function, boxed function definition).
The box labeled 'invoked business knowledge model' can be any boxed expression whose value is a function, as shown in Figure 10-4:

The boxed syntax maps to the textual syntax defined by grammar rules 38, 39, 40, 41. Boxed invocation uses named parameters.
Positional invocation can be achieved using a boxed expression containing a textual positional invocation.

The boxed syntax requires at least one parameter. A parameterless function must be invoked using the textual syntax,
e.g., as shown in Figure 10-5.
