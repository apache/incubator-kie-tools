## Flight Has Capacity

This basic example showcases a Boxed Function Expression using FEEL.
The diagram is from the air traffic domain.
The new flight is checked for capacity of the flights that will be rebooked according to two inputs:

- `Rebooked list` - A collection of flight numbers (or flights) to be rebooked.
- `Flight` - Is a structure containing a capacity number and a flight number.

The result (has capacity) is calculated by comparing the capacity of a flight with the capacity of the flight being rebooked.
If there is capacity on the new flight for the rebooked flight(s) the result is true, otherwise the result is false.
