## Payroll

The Payroll DMN demonstrates reusing logic through a decision service.
This example is a little more complex and takes a simple input, the Employee and reuses logic found in the output section of the Decision Service.

- `taxRate` - Contains tax rate data for the "US" and "UK"
- `vacationDays` - Also contains data for the "US" and "UK" about the number of vacation days
- `paymentDate` - Lists the payment dates for the "US" and "UK"

To compute actual payroll, an invocation is made passing in the employee.
This example could be reused or embedded in other examples.
