## Insurance Pricing

This basic example showcases a decision table used to arrive at a decision based on two inputs.
The diagram is a simplified insurance calculator.
Price for the insurance is calculated based on the age of the person and whether they have had any previous incidents.

- `Age` - The age in years of a person
- `had previous incidents` - A boolean representing prior incidents for the person.

The result (Insurance Total Price) is calculated via lookup of the possible combinations of values.
Note that not every value for `age` needs to be included in the decision table.
A range between 18 and 25, inclusive, and numbers higher than 25 are grouped within the decision table.
