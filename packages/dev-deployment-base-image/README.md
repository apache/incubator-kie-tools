# Dev Deployment Base Image

Docker image with Java and Maven, as well as the dev-deployment-upload-service binary installed and ready to be used.

## Build arguments

- `BUILDER_IMAGE_ARG`: The base image used for building this image (defaults to `registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/openjdk-17:1.20`).
  - Tested with:
    - registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/openjdk-17:1.20
    - icr.io/appcafe/ibm-semeru-runtimes:open-17-jdk-ubi-minimal

## Environment variables

### Pre defined (have a default value)

- `DEV_DEPLOYMENT__UPLOAD_SERVICE_EXTRACT_TO_DIR`: The directory to extract the files uploaded via the Upload Service. Defaults to `/app` inside the container.
- `DEV_DEPLOYMENT__UPLOAD_SERVICE_PORT`: The port where the Upload Service will listen on. Defaults to `8080`.

### Required

- `DEV_DEPLOYMENT__UPLOAD_SERVICE_API_KEY`: A string that represents the API Key the Upload Service accepts. It should be passed as a Query Param when making requests to the service.

### Optional

- `DEV_DEPLOYMENT__UPLOAD_SERVICE_ROOT_PATH`: If the Upload Service is not running in the root path of the URL, this variable should be specified.

## Test locally

Run the image with:

- `docker run -p 8080:8080 -e DEV_DEPLOYMENT__UPLOAD_SERVICE_API_KEY=123 docker.io/apache/incubator-kie-sandbox-dev-deployment-base:main 'dev-deployment-upload-service && ./mvnw quarkus:dev'`

Then upload a zip file containing the resources (full Java project)

- `curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" -F "myFile=@<ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_YOUR_FILE>" 'http://localhost:8080/upload?apiKey=123'`

Apache KIE (incubating) is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software
Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the name of Apache Incubator. Incubation is
required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that
the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized
in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation
status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the
code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.

Some of the incubating projectâ€™s releases may not be fully compliant with ASF
policy. For example, releases may have incomplete or un-reviewed licensing
conditions. What follows is a list of known issues the project is currently
aware of (note that this list, by definition, is likely to be incomplete):

- Hibernate, an LGPL project, is being used. Hibernate is in the process of
  relicensing to ASL v2
- Some files, particularly test files, and those not supporting comments, may
  be missing the ASF Licensing Header

If you are planning to incorporate this work into your product/project, please
be aware that you will need to conduct a thorough licensing review to determine
the overall implications of including this work. For the current status of this
