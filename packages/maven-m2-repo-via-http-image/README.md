## (private) Apache KIEâ„¢ :: Tools :: Maven M2 repo via HTTP

Used to expose the local Maven repository (E.g., ~/.m2/repository) via HTTP, so it can be used inside other container builds. This is important so that containers can include applications that depend on locally-built Maven artifacts.

Containers referencing this must make use of `settings.xml.envsubst` so that:

1. The default Maven blocker for repositories exposed via HTTP without TSL is disabled.
1. The exposed Maven repository via HTTP is accessible from within the container image build.

> NOTE: Host network access is not enabled by default during image builds. Use the `--allowHostNetworkAccess` option of `@kie-tools/image-builder` to enable it.

### Usage

Running the container:

- `docker run --name m2-repo-via-http -v ~/.m2/repository:/var/www/html -dit -p 8008:80 docker.io/apache/incubator-kie-tools-maven-m2-repo-via-http:main`

Interpolating settings.xml

- Linux and macOS:

  `M2_REPO_VIA_HTTP_URL_WITHOUT_PROTOCOL=localhost:8008 envsubst < settings.xml.envsubst > /tmp/settings.xml`

- Windows (PowerShell):

  `(Get-Content settings.xml.envsubst) -replace '$M2_REPO_VIA_HTTP_URL_WITHOUT_PROTOCOL', localhost:8008 | Set-Content /tmp/settings.xml`
