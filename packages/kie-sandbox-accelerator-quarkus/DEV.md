# @kie-tools/kie-sandbox-accelerator-quarkus (dev)

Developing this package requires you to actually run KIE Sandbox (`../online-editor`), so you can see it being applied on top of a new Workspace in there. Follow the development instructions on KIE Sandbox directly and rebuild this package after you make changes to it.
