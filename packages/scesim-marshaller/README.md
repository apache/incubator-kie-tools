# Project Structure

Below, a brief description of the project's structure:

| Directory                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `src`                    | Source root code. It cointans the index.ts file which offers the Marshalling/Unmarshalling API                                                                                                                                                   |
| `src/schemas/scesim-1_8` | It contains the Test Scenario 1.8 XSD Schema. After a build, this directory will contain the autogenerated code which cointans TypeScript types and metadata from XSD file(s) to be consumed (please refer to `@kie-tools/xml-parser-ts` module) |
| `test`                   | It contains integration tests to run against a set of scesim files                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `test-data--manual`      | The scesim files used for the integration tests.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

## How to build it

Apache KIE (incubating) is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software
Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the name of Apache Incubator. Incubation is
required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that
the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized
in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation
status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the
code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.

Some of the incubating project’s releases may not be fully compliant with ASF
policy. For example, releases may have incomplete or un-reviewed licensing
conditions. What follows is a list of known issues the project is currently
aware of (note that this list, by definition, is likely to be incomplete):

- Hibernate, an LGPL project, is being used. Hibernate is in the process of
  relicensing to ASL v2
- Some files, particularly test files, and those not supporting comments, may
  be missing the ASF Licensing Header

If you are planning to incorporate this work into your product/project, please
be aware that you will need to conduct a thorough licensing review to determine
the overall implications of including this work. For the current status of this
