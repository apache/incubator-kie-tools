<!-- This SVG is used for the subprocess's glyph, instead of using the subprocess.svg itself,
     which is used for the shape translation. This is due to the different inner icons,
     like for reusable or adhoc types, which require a bigger scale factor
     in order to make those inner icons visible enough when reducing the overall
     size to small values.
