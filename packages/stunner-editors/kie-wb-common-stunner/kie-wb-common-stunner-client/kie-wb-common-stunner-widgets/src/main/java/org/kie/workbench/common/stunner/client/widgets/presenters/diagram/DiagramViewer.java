/**
 * A viewer type for diagram instances based on any subtypes for <code>Diagram</code> and <code>AbstractCanvasHandler</code>.
 * <p>
 * The goal for a diagram viewer is to provide a DOM element that can be easily attached to other components
 * and encapsulates the components and logic necessary in order to open a diagram instance in a canvas.
 * It also must provide:
 * - A zoom control enabled for this viewer's canvas instance.
 * - A selection control enabled for this viewer's canvas handler instance.
 * Note the interaction with the selection control and other contexts, such as CDI, depends on its implementation.
 * Subtypes can provide additional controls.
 * <p>
 * The main usage for this component is as:
 * 1.- Load a diagram instance from backend using any of the Stunner's client services.
 * 2.- Create an injection point for <code>DiagramPresenterFactory</code>
 * 3.- Use the factory methods to create the right diagram viewer instance type for a given Diagram.
 * <p>
 * In case the default Stunner's behaviors, features and views do not fit a concrete Definition Set requirements,
 * different DiagramViewer types could be necessary for custom behaviors,
 * @param <D> The diagram type.
 * @param <H> The canvas handler type.
