This package contains graph processors that provide specific traversal for the different node/edge's content types.

- View traversal processor -> Use it for performing a traversal over the graph nodes that has View content
- Children traversal processor -> Use it for performing a traversal over the graph nodes that has Child content, so traverse the graph hierarchy using parent -> child direction
- Parent traversal processor -> Use it for performing a traversal over the graph nodes that has Parent content, so traverse the graph hierarchy using child -> parent direction
- Full content traversal processor -> Use it for performing a traversal over the all current available edge's contents: view, parent or child
