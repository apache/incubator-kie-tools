# Stunner forms extensions module

This module provides some extensions for [KIE Workbench Common Forms](../../../kie-wb-common-forms/) that are being used only in Stunner.

This module must only depend on the KIE Workbench Common Forms stuff and must not depend on any [Stunner Set](../../kie-wb-common-stunner-sets/).
Concrete forms required for any of the Stunner Sets must be created and provided in a client module for the concrete Stunner Set.
