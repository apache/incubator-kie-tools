     * Sets the CSS on the given widget so it automatically fills the available space, rather than being sized based on
     * the amount of space required by its contents. This tends to be useful when building a UI that always fills the
     * available space on the screen, as most desktop application windows do.
     * <p>
     * To achieve this, the element is given relative positioning with top and left set to 0px and width and height set
     * to 100%. This makes the widget fill its nearest ancestor which has relative or absolute positioning. This
     * technique is compatible with GWT's LayoutPanel system. Note that, like LayoutPanels, this only works if the host
     * page is in standards mode (has a {@code <!DOCTYPE html>} header).
     * @param w the widget that should always fill its available space, rather than being sized to fit its contents.
