# Dev Deployment Upload Service

This package is used on the KIE Sandbox's Dev Deployments feature and should be the first command to run when a deployed container spins up.

The Dev Deployment Upload Service runs an HTTP server that accepts ZIP file uploads to the `/upload` endpoint. You can check that the service is ready to accept uploads via the `/upload-status` endpoint.

When an upload is done, the application will unzip the file at the configured location and exit with a 0 code. If anything goes wrong during execution, it will exit with code 1 and a helpful message will be printed to stderr.

### Installation:

#### Via built binaries

Extract the .tar.gz file and copy the binary to your `/usr/local/bin` directory:

```bash
tar xf dist/dev-deployment-upload-service-<OS>-<ARCH>-<VERSION>.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin
```

You may need to run the command as root using `sudo`.

#### Via install script

- Run a server for the built files:
  ```bash
  pnpm build:dev
  pnpm start-test-servers
  ```
- In another terminal, run the installer script:
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:8092/getDevDeploymentUploadService.sh | bash
  ```
- After installed, you may stop the test servers:
  ```bash
  pnpm stop-test-servers
  ```

### Usage:

```
USAGE: `dev-deployment-upload-service`. Arguments are passed using env vars:
- DEV_DEPLOYMENT__UPLOAD_SERVICE_EXTRACT_TO_DIR	: Required. Where the uploaded zip will be extracted to. If it doesn't exist, it will be created.
- DEV_DEPLOYMENT__UPLOAD_SERVICE_PORT		: Required. Port where the HTTP Server will run at. The /upload endpoint will be made available.
- DEV_DEPLOYMENT__UPLOAD_SERVICE_API_KEY		: Required. Allowed API Key used as a queryParam at the /upload endpoint.
- DEV_DEPLOYMENT__UPLOAD_SERVICE_ROOT_PATH		: Subpath where the API endpoints will be at. Defaults to "/".
```

### Example:

For a Dev Deployment that runs a Quarkus application, the intended use is:

```Dockerfile
...

EXPOSE [port number]

ENV DEV_DEPLOYMENT__UPLOAD_SERVICE_EXTRACT_TO_DIR=[unzip dir path]
ENV DEV_DEPLOYMENT__UPLOAD_SERVICE_PORT=[port number]

CMD ["/bin/bash", "-c", "dev-deployment-upload-service && cd [unzip dir path] && mvn quarkus:dev"]
```

Then, when running your image, pass the following environment variables as parameters:

```
ENV DEV_DEPLOYMENT__UPLOAD_SERVICE_API_KEY=[api key]
ENV DEV_DEPLOYMENT__UPLOAD_SERVICE_ROOT_PATH=[subpath]
```

On KIE Sandbox Dev Deployments Kubernetes/OpenShift YAMLs, you can pass them like:

```yaml
...
spec:
  containers:
    ...
    env:
      - name: DEV_DEPLOYMENT__UPLOAD_SERVICE_API_KEY
        value: 'dev'
      - name: DEV_DEPLOYMENT__UPLOAD_SERVICE_ROOT_PATH
        value: '/'
```

### Develop:

```bash
# 1.
DEV_DEPLOYMENT__UPLOAD_SERVICE_EXTRACT_TO_DIR='/tmp/upload-service-dev' \
DEV_DEPLOYMENT__UPLOAD_SERVICE_PORT='8091' \
DEV_DEPLOYMENT__UPLOAD_SERVICE_API_KEY='dev' \
DEV_DEPLOYMENT__UPLOAD_SERVICE_ROOT_PATH='/' \
pnpm start
```

Apache KIE (incubating) is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software
Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the name of Apache Incubator. Incubation is
required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that
the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized
in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation
status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the
code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.

Some of the incubating projectâ€™s releases may not be fully compliant with ASF
policy. For example, releases may have incomplete or un-reviewed licensing
conditions. What follows is a list of known issues the project is currently
aware of (note that this list, by definition, is likely to be incomplete):

- Hibernate, an LGPL project, is being used. Hibernate is in the process of
  relicensing to ASL v2
- Some files, particularly test files, and those not supporting comments, may
  be missing the ASF Licensing Header

If you are planning to incorporate this work into your product/project, please
be aware that you will need to conduct a thorough licensing review to determine
the overall implications of including this work. For the current status of this
project through the Apache Incubator visit:
