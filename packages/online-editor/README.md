# End to End tests

There is a set of cypress tests in `e2e-tests` folder. To run them, please refer to one option bellow.

## Run tests manually

More suitable for running particular tests from `e2e-tests`.

- `packages/extended-services$ pnpm start`
- `packages/online-editor$ pnpm start`
- `packages/online-editor$ pnpm cy:open`

## Run tests automatically

More suitable for running `e2e-tests` completely.

- `packages/online-editor$ KIE_TOOLS_BUILD__runEndToEndTests=true pnpm test-e2e`

> **NOTE:**
> Before test development, you may need to build `online-editor` as:
>
> - `kie-tools$ pnpm bootstrap`
> - `kie-tools$ pnpm -r -F @kie-tools/online-editor... build:dev`

## Testing insecure/invalid TLS certificates with Git providers

- Install [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/docs/install)
- Run `sudo caddy run` or `sudo caddy stop`
- If asked to install certificates, choose "No"
- If on macOS or Windows add these lines to your `hosts` file:
  ```
  127.0.0.1 github.localhost
  127.0.0.1 gist.github.localhost
  127.0.0.1 bitbucket.localhost
  127.0.0.1 api.bitbucket.localhost
  ```
  _On Linux, localhosts subdomains work by default_
- Add these new AuthProviders to [defaultEnvJson.ts](build/defaultEnvJson.ts)
  ```js
  {
    enabled: true,
    id: "GitHub_at_Local",
    domain: "github.localhost",
    supportedGitRemoteDomains: [
      "github.localhost",
      "gist.github.localhost"
    ],
    type: AuthProviderType.github,
    name: "GitHub at Local",
    group: AuthProviderGroup.GIT,
    insecurelyDisableTlsCertificateValidation: true
  },
  {
    enabled: true,
    id: "Bitbucket_at_Local",
    domain: "bitbucket.localhost",
    supportedGitRemoteDomains: [
      "bitbucket.localhost",
    ],
    type: AuthProviderType.bitbucket,
    name: "Bitbucket at Local",
    group: AuthProviderGroup.GIT,
    insecurelyDisableTlsCertificateValidation: true
  }
  ```
- Start online-editor;
- To connect to `GitHub at Local` use a github.ibm.com account;
- To connect to `Bitbucket at Local` use a bitbucket.org account.

Obs.: _To use different Git providers remember to change the Caddyfile_;

Obs.: _`github.com` and `github.<enterprise_name>.com` use different APIs. If your Caddyfile is proxying `github.com` you'll need to change the `getGithubInstanceApiUrl` function in [github/Hooks.tsx](src/github/Hooks.tsx)_.

Apache KIE (incubating) is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software
Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the name of Apache Incubator. Incubation is
required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that
the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized
in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation
status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the
code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.

Some of the incubating projectâ€™s releases may not be fully compliant with ASF
policy. For example, releases may have incomplete or un-reviewed licensing
conditions. What follows is a list of known issues the project is currently
aware of (note that this list, by definition, is likely to be incomplete):

- Hibernate, an LGPL project, is being used. Hibernate is in the process of
  relicensing to ASL v2
- Some files, particularly test files, and those not supporting comments, may
  be missing the ASF Licensing Header

If you are planning to incorporate this work into your product/project, please
be aware that you will need to conduct a thorough licensing review to determine
the overall implications of including this work. For the current status of this
project through the Apache Incubator visit:
