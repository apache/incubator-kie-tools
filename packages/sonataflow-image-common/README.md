# sonataflow-image-common

This package contains the necessary resources to help other modules to build the `sonataflow-{builder|devmode}` images.

The contents of this package are:

- [Makefile](./resources/Makefile): convenience tool to help building and testing the images.
- [Cekit Modules](./resources/modules): Common Cekit Module descriptors to be used when building the images.
- [Utility Scripts](./resources/scripts): Utility scripts to be used during the image building process or bootstraping packages
- [Testing infra](./resources/tests): Testing infra to help testing the generated images

## Requirements

- **python3** with the following packages installed:
  - `behave` `lxml` `docker` `docker-squash` `elementPath` `pyyaml` `ruamel.yaml` `python-dateutil` `Jinja2` `pykwalify` `colorlog` `click`
- **cekit 4.11.0**: [docs.cekit.io](https://docs.cekit.io/en/latest/index.html)
- **make**
- **docker**

## Using the Makefile

To build and tests the images the package provides a convenient `Makefile` that will do the hard work for you. It relies in the following Envs (or arguments):

- `SWF_IMAGE_NAME`: (required) Specifies the image name to build. It should match the image descriptor.
- `SWF_IMAGE_REGISTRY`: Image registry to use, defaults to 'docker.io'
- `SWF_IMAGE_REGISTRY_ACCOUNT`: Image registry account to use, defaults to 'apache'
- `SWF_IMAGE_TAG`: Custom tag for the image. If not provided it will use the version in the image descriptor.

- `QUARKUS_PLATFORM_VERSION`: (required) Quarkus platform version to use inside the image.
- `KOGITO_VERSION`: (required) Kogito platform version to use inside the image.

- `CEKIT_BUILD_OPTIONS`: extra build options, please refer to [docs.cekit.io](https://docs.cekit.io/en/latest/index.html)
- `BUILD_ENGINE`: (docker/podman) engine used to build the image, defaults to docker
- `BUILD_ENGINE_OPTIONS`: extra build options to pass to the build engine

## Building images..

- Copy your image descriptor and modules along with the contents of the `resources` into a separate folder (eg: `/tmp/build`)

Apache KIE (incubating) is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software
Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the name of Apache Incubator. Incubation is
required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that
the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized
in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation
status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the
code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.

Some of the incubating projectâ€™s releases may not be fully compliant with ASF
policy. For example, releases may have incomplete or un-reviewed licensing
conditions. What follows is a list of known issues the project is currently
aware of (note that this list, by definition, is likely to be incomplete):

- Hibernate, an LGPL project, is being used. Hibernate is in the process of
  relicensing to ASL v2
- Some files, particularly test files, and those not supporting comments, may
  be missing the ASF Licensing Header

If you are planning to incorporate this work into your product/project, please
be aware that you will need to conduct a thorough licensing review to determine
the overall implications of including this work. For the current status of this
