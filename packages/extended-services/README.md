## Misc

### Configuration

In the `config.yaml` file you will be able to configure Proxy, Runner and Modeler properties as runner location or modeler URL. Runner ip is `127.0.0.1` and port is a random free port.

### How do I create the image.go?

Firstly install the 2goarray package
`go get github.com/cratonica/2goarray`

Then convert the image to a .go file
`cat icon2.png | /Users/aparedes/go/bin/2goarray Data images > icon.go`

### API

#### `/`

The root route is a proxy and will forward your requests to the autogenerated port

#### `/ping`

[GET] returns the API version, the proxy port and IP and the Modeler URL.

```json
{
  "App": {
    "Version": "0.0.0"

  "Proxy": {
    "IP": "127.0.0.1",
