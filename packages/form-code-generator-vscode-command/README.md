## Form Code Generator VS Code command

This package is a VS Code command for generating form code from jBPM projects.

## How it works?

The command provides a user-friendly interface for generating form code from jBPM projects. It interacts with the file system getting the jBPM JSON Schemas that are generated during compile time, and feeding them to the "form-code-generator" that will generate the form code using one of two themes: Bootstrap4 or Patternfly.

## Usage

The command name will change depending on the host extension, but it should be available in the command palette. After starting the command, the user will be prompted with a few questions, which can be represented using the following diagram:

![VS Code command diagram](./docs/vscode-command-diagram.png?raw=true "VS Code command diagram")

## Build

In order to build the library you must run the following command in the root folder of the repository:

```shell script
pnpm -F @kie-tools/form-code-generator-vscode-command... build:prod
```

Apache KIE (incubating) is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software
Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the name of Apache Incubator. Incubation is
required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that
the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized
in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation
status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the
code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.

Some of the incubating projectâ€™s releases may not be fully compliant with ASF
policy. For example, releases may have incomplete or un-reviewed licensing
conditions. What follows is a list of known issues the project is currently
aware of (note that this list, by definition, is likely to be incomplete):

- Hibernate, an LGPL project, is being used. Hibernate is in the process of
  relicensing to ASL v2
- Some files, particularly test files, and those not supporting comments, may
  be missing the ASF Licensing Header

If you are planning to incorporate this work into your product/project, please
be aware that you will need to conduct a thorough licensing review to determine
the overall implications of including this work. For the current status of this
