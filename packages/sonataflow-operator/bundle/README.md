# SonataFlow Operator Bundle

To generate the files in [manifests](manifests) directory run from the project's root:

```shell
make generate-all
make vet fmt
```

The file `sonataflow-operator.clusterserviceversion.yaml` will be generated as part of the outcome of this command.
This file has been removed from git since every time the command runs, it generates the attribute `createdAt`.
