# Workflow Project Handler

Handler to programmatically convert a local SonataFlow project into Kubernetes manifests to deploy with
the operator.

## How to

Add this module to your project's dependencies:

```shell
go get github.com/kiegroup/kogito-serverless-workflow/workflowproj
```

Then you should have access to the main entry point of this package, which is the workflow project handler builder.

The API is simple enough to describe in a few lines:

```go
package main

import (
	"os"

	"github.com/apache/incubator-kie-tools/packages/sonataflow-operator/workflowproj"
)

func Main() {
	// we are ignoring errors just for demo purposes, but don't do this!
	workflowFile, _ := os.Open("myworkflow.sw.json")
	propertiesFile, _ := os.Open("application.properties")
	specFile, _ := os.Open("myopenapi.yaml")
	defer workflowFile.Close()
	defer propertiesFile.Close()
	defer specFile.Close()

	// create the handler
	handler := workflowproj.New("mynamespace").
		WithWorkflow(workflowFile).
		WithAppProperties(propertiesFile).
		AddResource("myopenapi.yaml", specFile)

	// You can easily generate the Kubernetes manifests to later use client-go to deploy them in the cluster...
	objs, _ := handler.AsObjects()
	// client.Create(...), other stuff

	// ... or you can save the files locally to use them later or to integrate in a GitOps process
	_ = handler.SaveAsKubernetesManifests("/my/dir/")
}
```

The `SonataFlow` custom resource generated is annotated with
the [devmode profile](https://kiegroup.github.io/kogito-docs/serverlessworkflow/latest/cloud/operator/developing-workflows.html)
.
Every other resource added to the project is a `ConfigMap` handling these resources for you.

Given that you already have the SonataFlow
Operator [installed](https://kiegroup.github.io/kogito-docs/serverlessworkflow/latest/cloud/operator/install-serverless-operator.html)
, to deploy the generated project you can simply run:

```shell
kubectl apply -f /my/dir/* -n "mynamespace"
```

Apache KIE (incubating) is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software
Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the name of Apache Incubator. Incubation is
required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that
the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized
in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation
status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the
code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.

Some of the incubating projectâ€™s releases may not be fully compliant with ASF
policy. For example, releases may have incomplete or un-reviewed licensing
conditions. What follows is a list of known issues the project is currently
aware of (note that this list, by definition, is likely to be incomplete):

- Hibernate, an LGPL project, is being used. Hibernate is in the process of
  relicensing to ASL v2
- Some files, particularly test files, and those not supporting comments, may
  be missing the ASF Licensing Header

If you are planning to incorporate this work into your product/project, please
be aware that you will need to conduct a thorough licensing review to determine
the overall implications of including this work. For the current status of this
