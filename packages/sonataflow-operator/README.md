# SonataFlow Operator

The SonataFlow Operator defines a set
of [Kubernetes Custom Resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/)
to help users to deploy SonataFlow projects on Kubernetes and OpenShift.

Please [visit our official documentation](https://kiegroup.github.io/kogito-docs/serverlessworkflow/latest/cloud/operator/install-serverless-operator.html)
to know more.

## Available modules for integrations

If you're a developer, and you are interested in integrating your project or application with the SonataFlow Operator
ecosystem, this repository provides a few Go Modules described below.

### SonataFlow Operator Types (api)

Every custom resource managed by the operator is exported in the module [api](api). You can use it to programmatically
create any custom type managed by the operator.
To use it, simply run:

```shell
go get github.com/kiegroup/kogito-serverless-workflow/api
```

Then you can create any type programmatically, for example:

```go
workflow := &v1alpha08.SonataFlow{
ObjectMeta: metav1.ObjectMeta{Name: w.name, Namespace: w.namespace},
Spec:       v1alpha08.SonataFlowSpec{Flow: *myWorkflowDef>}
}
```

You can use the [Kubernetes client-go library](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go) to manipulate these objects in
the cluster.

You might need to register our schemes:

```go
    s := scheme.Scheme
utilruntime.Must(v1alpha08.AddToScheme(s))
```

### Container Builder (container-builder)

Please see the module's [README file](container-builder/README.md).

### Workflow Project Handler (workflowproj)

Please see the module's [README file](workflowproj/README.md).

## Development and Contributions

Contributing is easy, just take a look at our [contributors](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)'guide.

Apache KIE (incubating) is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software
Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the name of Apache Incubator. Incubation is
required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that
the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized
in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation
status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the
code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.

Some of the incubating projectâ€™s releases may not be fully compliant with ASF
policy. For example, releases may have incomplete or un-reviewed licensing
conditions. What follows is a list of known issues the project is currently
aware of (note that this list, by definition, is likely to be incomplete):

- Hibernate, an LGPL project, is being used. Hibernate is in the process of
  relicensing to ASL v2
- Some files, particularly test files, and those not supporting comments, may
  be missing the ASF Licensing Header

If you are planning to incorporate this work into your product/project, please
be aware that you will need to conduct a thorough licensing review to determine
the overall implications of including this work. For the current status of this
project through the Apache Incubator visit:
