# Kogito DB Migrator Tool

This is a Java, Quarkus-based database migrator application for Data-Index and Jobs Service applications for use by SonataFlow Operator supporting PostgreSQL database currently. Future versions are expected to support more database variants.

_NOTE_: This database migrator application and its corresponding images are only envisaged to be made use of by SonataFlow Operator, Data Index and Jobs Service internally. Conversely this application is of no use outside the usecases involved with SonataFlow Operator, Data Index and Jobs Service applications.

Apache KIE (incubating) is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software
Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the name of Apache Incubator. Incubation is
required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that
the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized
in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation
status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the
code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.

Some of the incubating projectâ€™s releases may not be fully compliant with ASF
policy. For example, releases may have incomplete or un-reviewed licensing
conditions. What follows is a list of known issues the project is currently
aware of (note that this list, by definition, is likely to be incomplete):

- Hibernate, an LGPL project, is being used. Hibernate is in the process of
  relicensing to ASL v2
- Some files, particularly test files, and those not supporting comments, may
  be missing the ASF Licensing Header

If you are planning to incorporate this work into your product/project, please
be aware that you will need to conduct a thorough licensing review to determine
the overall implications of including this work. For the current status of this
