# SonataFlow Management Console Webapp

The Sonataflow Management Console Webapp is a production-ready web application designed for managing and monitoring serverless workflows. It includes security features such as user authentication integrating with Keycloak Server.

## Enabling Keycloak security

### Starting and Configuring the Keycloak Server

To start a Keycloak Server you can use Docker and just run the following command:

```
docker run -e KEYCLOAK_ADMIN=admin -e KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin -v ./dev/config/sonataflow-realm.json:/opt/keycloak/data/import/realm.json -p 8280:8080 registry.redhat.io/rhbk/keycloak-rhel9:24 start-dev --import-realm
```

You should be able to access your Keycloak Server at [localhost:8280/admin](http://localhost:8280/admin)
and verify keycloak server is running properly: log in as the admin user to access the Keycloak Administration Console.
Username should be admin and password admin.

The following are the users available in keycloak

| Login | Password | Roles               |
| ----- | -------- | ------------------- |
| admin | admin    | _admin_, _managers_ |
| alice | alice    | _user_              |
| jdoe  | jdoe     | _managers_          |

To change any of this client configuration access to http://localhost:8280/admin/master/console/#/kogito.

### Changing configs

Enable `PROD` env mode by running the app with:

`SONATAFLOW_MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE_WEBAPP__sonataflowEnvMode=PROD pnpm start`

Apache KIE (incubating) is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software
Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the name of Apache Incubator. Incubation is
required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that
the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized
in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation
status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the
code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.

Some of the incubating projectâ€™s releases may not be fully compliant with ASF
policy. For example, releases may have incomplete or un-reviewed licensing
conditions. What follows is a list of known issues the project is currently
aware of (note that this list, by definition, is likely to be incomplete):

- Hibernate, an LGPL project, is being used. Hibernate is in the process of
  relicensing to ASL v2
- Some files, particularly test files, and those not supporting comments, may
  be missing the ASF Licensing Header

If you are planning to incorporate this work into your product/project, please
be aware that you will need to conduct a thorough licensing review to determine
the overall implications of including this work. For the current status of this
