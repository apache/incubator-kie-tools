/**
 * WorkbenchActivity and its subinterfaces define the interface between UberFire framework behaviour and
 * application-defined behaviour.
 * <p>
 * In the model-view-presenter (MVP) sense, an Activity is essentially an application-provided Presenter: it has a view
 * (its widget) and it defines a set of operations that can affect that view.
 * <p>
 * Applications can implement an Activity interface directly, they can subclass one of the abstract Activity
 * implementations that come with the framework, or they may rely on UberFire's annotation processors to generate
 * Activity implementations from annotated Java objects.
 * <p>
 * For example, to define a new Screen in an application, you can implement {@link WorkbenchScreenActivity}, extend
 * {@link AbstractWorkbenchScreenActivity}, or annotate a class with {@link WorkbenchScreen} and follow the rules
 * associated with that annotation.
 * <p>
 * Similarly for {@link WorkbenchEditorActivity}, {@link AbstractWorkbenchEditorActivity} and {@link WorkbenchEditor};
 * {@link PerspectiveActivity}, {@link AbstractWorkbenchPerspectiveActivity}, and {@link WorkbenchPerspective}; and so
 * on.
