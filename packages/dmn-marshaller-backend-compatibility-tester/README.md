The scope of this module is to provide a reliable scripting mechanism that tests DMN Files generated by the `dmn-marshaller` module against backend counterpart code that lives in the drools repository.
The scripts are based on [JBang!](https://www.jbang.dev/) that provides an out-of-the-box library to be consumed in NodeJs.

At the moment of writing, two scripts are available:

- DMN Validation, that can validate a DMN file (and its imported DMN assets) using the [KIE DMN Validator](https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-drools/tree/main/kie-dmn/kie-dmn-validation) back-end module.
- DMN Semantic Comparison, that compares two DMN files (and their imported DMN assets) using a Backend logic that relies on KIE DMN Engine core code.

Every script is defined in a single Java class. Inside those, you can find a list of fields (marked with `@Option` annotation) that represents the commands and the their required parameters to run the scripts.

An abstract class is defined as parent class of all defined scripts.
