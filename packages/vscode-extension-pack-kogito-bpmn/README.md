BPMN Editor
--

## Release notes - 0.1.0 (alpha)

- Open and edit BPMN and BPMN2 files using the KIE Group BPMN editor.
- Save changes using built-in `Save` and `Save All` commands.
- Use keyboard shortcuts right on the BPMN editor like `Ctrl+Z` (undo), `Ctrl+C` (copy), `Ctrl+V` (paste). Note that on macOS you have to use `Ctrl` too, and not `Cmd`. We are working on fixing that on the next releases.
- If a BPMN editor is already open but you want to see a file as text, you can right-click on this file and choose "Open to the side". VSCode editor will split in half and the file will open as text.
