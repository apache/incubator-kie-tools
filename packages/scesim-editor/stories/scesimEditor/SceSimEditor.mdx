# SceSim Editor

    Before deploying them into a production environment, test scenarios enable you to validate the functionality of
    - Business rules and business rule data (for rules-based test scenarios)
    - DMN models (for DMN-based test scenarios)

    With a test scenario, you use data from your project to set given conditions and expected results based on one or more defined business rules. When you run the scenario, the expected results and actual results of the rule instance are compared.

    If the expected results match the actual results, the test is successful. If the expected results do not match the actual results, then the test fails.
