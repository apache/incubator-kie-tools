# Complex Collection

This is an example of a Test Scenario with a column representing a List of Complex DMN object.

The related DMN is `complex_collection.dmn`, defined in the `ExternalDmnModel.ts` file

The GIVEN parameters of the Test Scenario are composed by a Team (of type tTeam) input node. Its attributes are:

- name : string (The team name)
- people : List of tPerson (The list of the people in the team).

tPerson type is composed by:

- name : string
- age : number

The EXPECT paramenter determines if the team is huge or not (Based on the DMN logic, a team is huge if cointains more than 3 people)
