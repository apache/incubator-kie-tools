# Resizing

The SceSim Editor gives the possibility to resize every cell in a column.
The resize operation recursively affects all sub columns that are part of the same column
keeping the resize operation consistent.

To perform the resize operation hover the mouse on a cell of the desired column.
A resize handle on the right side of the cell will appear. Left-clicking on it and dragging
will resize the cell. The minimum depends on the expression or column. It does not have a maximum width.

# Reset

To reset the size of a column hover the mouse on a cell of the column.
The resize handle on the right side of the cell will appear. Double left-clicking on it will
reset the column size to the default value. It's important to notice that the default size
can vary depending on sub columns.
