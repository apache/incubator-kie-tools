## YARD validator

###### Module for YARD (Yet Another Rule Definition) validation.

### Description

This module contains a standalone J2CL/Java module that can be used to validate YARD file. J2CL version is recommended
to be ran in a webworker due to the heavy load.

There is a static test page at demo/demo.html. Build the project before running it.

### Validation items currently covered

- Subsumption, when one row "eats" another by covering the same constraints as the subsumed row.
- Redundant rows. Either the same result is duplicated or one row is useless.

### Validation item ideas for future

- Masked rows, when a row subsumes another, but also blocks the subsumed row from getting ever activated.
- Conflicting rows. Two rows return different results with overlapping or subsuming constraints.
- Overlapping rows. Two rows can be activated by the same data, but the rows do not subsume each other.
- Gaps between the rows

Apache KIE (incubating) is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software
Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the name of Apache Incubator. Incubation is
required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that
the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized
in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation
status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the
code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.

Some of the incubating projectâ€™s releases may not be fully compliant with ASF
policy. For example, releases may have incomplete or un-reviewed licensing
conditions. What follows is a list of known issues the project is currently
aware of (note that this list, by definition, is likely to be incomplete):

- Hibernate, an LGPL project, is being used. Hibernate is in the process of
  relicensing to ASL v2
- Some files, particularly test files, and those not supporting comments, may
  be missing the ASF Licensing Header

If you are planning to incorporate this work into your product/project, please
be aware that you will need to conduct a thorough licensing review to determine
the overall implications of including this work. For the current status of this
