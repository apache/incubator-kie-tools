## jBPM Form Code Generator

This package has two jBPM themes for the [form-code-generator](../form-code-generator/README.md) library. Both themes are extensions of the [Bootstrap4 theme](../form-code-generator-bootstrap4-theme/README.md) and [PatternFly theme](../form-code-generator-patternfly-theme/README.md), resulting in the jBPM Bootstrap4 theme and jBPM PatternFly theme respectively.

## Usage

To use it, pass the jBPM theme to the `generateFormCode` function:

```ts
import { generateFormCode } from "@kie-tools/form-code-generator/dist/generateFormCode";
import { jbpmPatternflyFormCodeGeneratorTheme } from "@kie-tools/jbpm-form-code-generator-themes/dist/jbpmPatternflyFormCodeGeneratorTheme";

const jbpmFormsCode = generateFormCode({
  formCodeGeneratorTheme: jbpmPatternflyFormCodeGeneratorTheme,
  formSchemas: [
    {
      name: "<name>",
      schema: {}, // Your JSON Schema
    },
  ],
});
```

The `jbpmFormsCode` will give you the following object:

```ts
[{
  formAsset: JbpmFormAssets | undefined
  formError: FormCodeGenerationError | undefined
}]
```

`JbpmFormAssets` is a object with the following properties:

```ts
{
  name: string,                             // The form id
  nameWithoutInvalidTsVarChars: string,     // The same value as "id" but any "#" occorrence is replaced by "_"
  fileName: string,                         // The form name
  fileNameWithoutInvalidVarChars: string,      // The same value as "assetName" but any "#" occorrence is replaced by "_"
  fileExt: string,                          // The file extension of the code
  content: string,                          // The unescaped form code
  config: {
    schema: string,                         // The stringifyied JSON Schema
    resources: {
      styles: {},                           // Any style that need to be loaded
      scripts: {},                          // Any script that need to be loaded
    },
  },
}
```

`FormCodeGenerationError` is a object with the following properties:

```ts
{
  error: Error; // The error object that was thrown during the form generation
}
```

## Build

In order to build the library you must run the following command in the root folder of the repository:

```shell script
pnpm -F @kie-tools/jbpm-form-code-generator-themes... build:prod
```

Apache KIE (incubating) is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software
Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the name of Apache Incubator. Incubation is
required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that
the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized
in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation
status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the
code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.

Some of the incubating projectâ€™s releases may not be fully compliant with ASF
policy. For example, releases may have incomplete or un-reviewed licensing
conditions. What follows is a list of known issues the project is currently
aware of (note that this list, by definition, is likely to be incomplete):

- Hibernate, an LGPL project, is being used. Hibernate is in the process of
  relicensing to ASL v2
- Some files, particularly test files, and those not supporting comments, may
  be missing the ASF Licensing Header

If you are planning to incorporate this work into your product/project, please
be aware that you will need to conduct a thorough licensing review to determine
the overall implications of including this work. For the current status of this
project through the Apache Incubator visit:
