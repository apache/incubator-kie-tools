## Form Code Generator

This library is used to generate the form code based on a schema. It uses different themes, such as the [Bootstrap4](../form-code-generator-bootstrap4-theme/README.md) and [PatternFly](../form-code-generator-patternfly-theme/README.md) or any theme that implements the [FormCodeGeneratorTheme](./src/types.ts) interface.

## How it works?

This library provides types and interfaces to be used by themes. The `generateFormCode` function receives a list of schemas where the theme will be applied. The generated code or error are returned to the caller.

## Usage

To use it, call the `generateFormCode` function passing your theme to its arguments:

```ts
import { generateFormCode } from "@kie-tools/form-code-generator/dist/generateFormCode"
import { FormCodeGeneratorTheme } from "@kie-tools/form-code-generator/dist/types"

const formCode = generateFormCode({
  formSchemas: [
    {
      formSchema: {
        name: "my form name",   // Form name
        schema: {},             // My form schema. The theme determines which kind of schema will be supported.
      },
    },
  ],
  formCodeGeneratorTheme: {
    generate: ({ name, schema }) => { ... };
  },
});

formsCode[0];                 // FormAsset | FormGenerationError
```

Example using the [PatternFly](../form-code-generator-patternfly-theme/README.md) theme:

```ts
import { generateFormCode } from "@kie-tools/form-code-generator/dist/generateFormCode";
import { patternflyFormCodeGeneratorTheme } from "@kie-tools/form-code-generator-patternfly-theme/dist/theme";

const formsCode = generateFormCode({
  formSchemas: [
    {
      formSchema: {
        name: "my patternfly form", // Form name
        schema: {}, // My form JSON Schema.
      },
    },
  ],
  formCodeGeneratorTheme: patternflyFormCodeGeneratorTheme,
});

formsCode[0]; // FormAsset | FormGenerationError
```

## Build

In order to build the library you must run the following command in the root folder of the repository:

```shell script
pnpm -F @kie-tools/form-code-generator... build:prod
```

Apache KIE (incubating) is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software
Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the name of Apache Incubator. Incubation is
required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that
the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized
in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation
status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the
code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.

Some of the incubating projectâ€™s releases may not be fully compliant with ASF
policy. For example, releases may have incomplete or un-reviewed licensing
conditions. What follows is a list of known issues the project is currently
aware of (note that this list, by definition, is likely to be incomplete):

- Hibernate, an LGPL project, is being used. Hibernate is in the process of
  relicensing to ASL v2
- Some files, particularly test files, and those not supporting comments, may
  be missing the ASF Licensing Header

If you are planning to incorporate this work into your product/project, please
be aware that you will need to conduct a thorough licensing review to determine
the overall implications of including this work. For the current status of this
project through the Apache Incubator visit:
