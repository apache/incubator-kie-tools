# sonataflow-devmode

This package contains the `cekit` image descriptor (`sonataflow-devmode-image.yaml`) and modules needed to build the `sonataflow-devmode`
image along with the modules and scripts provided in `@kie-tools/sonataflow-image-common`.

## Additional requirements

- **python3** with the following packages installed:
  - `behave` `lxml` `docker` `docker-squash` `elementPath` `pyyaml` `ruamel.yaml` `python-dateutil` `Jinja2` `pykwalify` `colorlog` `click`
- **cekit 4.11.0**: [docs.cekit.io](https://docs.cekit.io/en/latest/index.html)
- **s2i**: [source-to-image](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image)
- **make**
- **docker**

## Build

- Enable the image to be built:

  ```bash
  export KIE_TOOLS_BUILD__buildContainerImages=true
  ```

- (Optional) The image name and tags can be customized by setting the following environment variables:

  ```bash
  export SONATAFLOW_DEVMODE_IMAGE__registry=<registry>
  export SONATAFLOW_DEVMODE_IMAGE__account=<account>
  export SONATAFLOW_DEVMODE_IMAGE__name=<image-name>
  export SONATAFLOW_DEVMODE_IMAGE__buildTag=<image-tag>
  ```

  > Default values can be found [here](./env/index.js).

- After optionally setting up the environment variables, run the following in the root folder of the repository to build the package:

  ```bash
  pnpm -F @kie-tools/sonataflow-devmode-image build:prod
  ```

- Then check if the image is correctly stored:

  ```bash
  docker images
  ```

## Testing the generated image (only for Linux)

- With the image generated, run:

  ```bash
  pnpm -F @kie-tools/sonataflow-devmode-image image:test
  ```

Apache KIE (incubating) is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software
Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the name of Apache Incubator. Incubation is
required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that
the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized
in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation
status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the
code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.

Some of the incubating projectâ€™s releases may not be fully compliant with ASF
policy. For example, releases may have incomplete or un-reviewed licensing
conditions. What follows is a list of known issues the project is currently
aware of (note that this list, by definition, is likely to be incomplete):

- Hibernate, an LGPL project, is being used. Hibernate is in the process of
  relicensing to ASL v2
- Some files, particularly test files, and those not supporting comments, may
  be missing the ASF Licensing Header

If you are planning to incorporate this work into your product/project, please
be aware that you will need to conduct a thorough licensing review to determine
the overall implications of including this work. For the current status of this
project through the Apache Incubator visit:
