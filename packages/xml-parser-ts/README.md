# @kie-tools/xml-parser-ts

This lets you parse/build XML strings from/to JSON using types and metadata generated with `@kie-tools/xml-parser-ts-codegen`. It uses `fast-xml-parser` to do parse/build the XMLs and guarantees that:

1. Parse/builds are idempotent for XMLs created with
1. The JSON resulting from parsing is type-safe, as the metada generated by `@kie-tools/xml-parser-ts-codegen` provides information on what is a string, a boolean, an integer, a float or an array. Even if there's only one element on a sequence, `@kie-tools/xml-parser-ts` will make sure it is an array with length 1.
1. The types generated by `@kie-tools/xml-parser-ts-codegen` can be extended and parsed/built.
1. Unknown elements/attributes are ignored

### Some characteristics:

1. Entity processing is turned on. This means that CDATA blocks will be inlined and the default entities supportes by `fast-xml-parser` will be processed.
1. Empty tags are not self-closed when building.
1. Namespaces declared on the original XML are preserved when building from the JSON.
