# @kie-tools/xml-parser-ts

This lets you parse/build XML strings from/to JSON using types and metadata generated with `@kie-tools/xml-parser-ts-codegen`. It uses DOMParser or `jsdom` to parse the XMLs and guarantees that:

1. Parse/builds are idempotent for XMLs created with
1. The JSON resulting from parsing is type-safe, as the metada generated by `@kie-tools/xml-parser-ts-codegen` provides information on what is a string, a boolean, an integer, a float or an array. Even if there's only one element on a sequence, `@kie-tools/xml-parser-ts` will make sure it is an array with length 1.
1. The types generated by `@kie-tools/xml-parser-ts-codegen` can be extended and parsed/built.
1. Unknown elements/attributes are kept in the original JSON.
1. Comments ignored.

### Some characteristics:

1. Namespaces declared on the original XML can be preserved when building from the JSON.
