/**
 * A preview presenter type for generic client session instances.
 * <p/>
 * The goal for the session preview presenter is to replicate the active session's diagram, canvas and handler states
 * into another different canvas instance, which is handled by a proxy canvas handler type. Having different canvas
 * instances replicated can be useful for goals such as:
 * - The session's diagram potentially being replicated in the preview's canvas
 * - Possibility to execute commands against the preview's canvas handler's instance to update the preview's canvas state
 * without affecting the session's canvas.
 * - Possibility to use different canvas control instances for the preview's presenter, so for example, different
 * mediators (zoom, pan) and other behaviors can be done separately on each canvas.
 * <p/>
 * As it inherits from a Viewer type, it provides by default a zoom control enabled for this viewer session's canvas instance.
 * @param <S> The session type.
 * @param <D> The diagram type.
