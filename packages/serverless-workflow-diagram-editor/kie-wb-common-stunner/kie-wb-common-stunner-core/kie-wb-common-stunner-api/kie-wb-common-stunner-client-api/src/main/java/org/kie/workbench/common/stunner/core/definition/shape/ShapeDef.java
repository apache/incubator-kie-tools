 * - Hides the graph complexity and processing behind the diagram to represent and it lets focusing
 * on how the bean must be represented.
 * - Subtypes can add additional methods for binding their beans to Shapes.
 * - Shape Definitions are shared types for both client and server, they cannot contain view or server
