/**
 * A rule evaluation handler is able to evaluate a certain rule type in a
 * given context type.
 * <p>
 * Rule evaluation handlers are application scoped beans that
 * allow or deny some operation in a certain context against
 * onr or more rule instances Rules provide the runtime inputs and
 * rule contexts provide the evaluation scenario.
 * @param <R> The rule type.
 * @param <C> The evaluation context type.
 * @See {@link Rule}
 * @See {@link RuleEvaluationContext}
 * <p>
 * Consider the following example, which is provided as an stunner
 * built-in feature - Consider an entity-relation graph structure
 * that allows parent-child relationships. In that structure a node can
 * be set as a child for other node but only in a certain condition, in this
 * case a condition based on the roles for the candidate node (the node to
 * be set as child for the parent one). This way:
 * - Exists an evaluation context type for containment goals, which provides
 * the necessary information to evaluate if the operation must be allowed or denied.
 * - Exist one or more rules that provide the concrete candidate's roles allowed for
 * the containment relationship.
 * - Finally given one or more rules and the containment context inputs, the rule evaluation
 * handler is able to perform the evaluation/s at runtime.
