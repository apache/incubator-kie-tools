# Lienzo extensions module

This module provides some extensions for [Lienzo](https://github.com/ahome-it/).

The extensions on this module must only depend on pure lienzo artifacts, do not include stunner stuff here.

PS: The idea is that at some point, the classes into this module can be easily moved into Ahome repositories if necessary.
