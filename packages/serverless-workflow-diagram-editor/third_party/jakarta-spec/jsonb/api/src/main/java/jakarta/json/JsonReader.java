/**
 * Reads a JSON {@link JsonObject object} or an {@link JsonArray array} structure from an input
 * source.
 *
 * <p>The class {@link jakarta.json.Json} contains methods to create readers from input sources
 * ({@link java.io.InputStream} and {@link java.io.Reader}).
 *
 * <p>The following example demonstrates how to read an empty JSON array from a string:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * JsonReader jsonReader = Json.createReader(new StringReader("[]"));
 * JsonArray array = jsonReader.readArray();
 * jsonReader.close();
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>The class {@link JsonReaderFactory} also contains methods to create {@code JsonReader}
 * instances. A factory instance can be used to create multiple reader instances with the same
 * configuration. This the preferred way to create multiple instances. A sample usage is shown in
 * the following example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * JsonReaderFactory factory = Json.createReaderFactory(config);
 * JsonReader reader1 = factory.createReader(...);
 * JsonReader reader2 = factory.createReader(...);
 * </code>
 * </pre>
