 * This is the API that will let communicate with Notifications channel implementation. There are two types of Notifications:
 * Alerts ({@link NotificationType#ALERT}) and Problems ({@link NotificationType#ALERT}). The main difference between
 * Alerts and Problems is the lifespan. Alerts are ephemeral (like a "Compilation Success" notifications) and Problems
 * are information we need to keep, so we can take actions based on them.
 * Problems supports severities {@link NotificationSeverity#INFO} {@link NotificationSeverity#ERROR}
 * {@link NotificationSeverity#HINT} {@link NotificationSeverity#WARNING}. Any other severity will be treated as INFO.
 * Alerts supports severities {@link NotificationSeverity#INFO} and {@link NotificationSeverity#ERROR}. Any other
