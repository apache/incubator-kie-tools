BPMN, DMN and Test Scenario Editors

## Release notes - 0.4.2 (alpha)

We are happy to announce a fresh new Kogito Tooling release! ðŸŽ‰

On this release, we did a lot of improvements and bug fixes. The highlight of this release is the inclusion of the alpha version of our newest editor for Test Scenarios (`.scesim` extension).

**NOTE**: This release only works on VS Code 1.45.0 and later.

**NOTE**: The Undo/Redo and Dirty Files Detection mechanism are fixed on VS Code 1.45.0, with the caveat that Undo/Redo operations only work via keyboard shortcuts. We hope that this will be fixed on VS Code 1.46.0 release. See tracking of this issue [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/90110).
