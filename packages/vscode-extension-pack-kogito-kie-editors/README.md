BPMN and DMN Editors

## Release notes - 0.3.1 (alpha)

We are happy to announce a fresh new Kogito Tooling release! On this release, we did a lot of improvements and bug fixes. 

**NOTE:** Due to some API changes on VSCode Custom Editor API, Undo/Redo and Dirty Indicator are broken on VS Code 1.44.x. We expect that this issue will be solved hopefully on the next VS Code release, in about a month from now. We are tracking the progress of this issue on [KOGITO-1835](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KOGITO-1835).
