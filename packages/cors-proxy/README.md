# cors-proxy

This package contains a `cors-proxy`, which is a simple Node.js application intended to be used to solve CORS issues while connecting our front end tools (online-editor, serverless-logic-web-tools) with external services (GitHub, Bitbucket, OpenShift, Kubernetes...)

# Build

```bash
$ pnpm @kie-tools/cors-proxy... build:prod
```

# Configuration

The `cors-proxy` can be configured via environment variables:

- _CORS_PROXY_HTTP_PORT_: Sets the HTTP Port the proxy should listen to
- _CORS_PROXY_ORIGIN_: Sets the value of the 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header, defaults to `*`
- _CORS_PROXY_VERBOSE_: Allows the proxy to run in verbose mode... useful to trace requests on development environments. Defaults to `false`

For example:

```bash
$ export CORS_PROXY_HTTP_PORT=8080
$ export CORS_PROXY_ORIGIN=*
$ export CORS_PROXY_VERBOSE=false
```

# Running `cors-proxy`

After building the package and setting up the environment variables, in the package folder run the following command:

```bash
$ node ./dist/index.js
```

# Running `cors-proxy` in dev mode.

```bash
$ pnpm @kie-tools/cors-proxy start
```

You can also use the following envs to configure `cors-proxy` when starting in dev-mode:

```bash
$ export CORS_PROXY__port=*
$ export CORS_PROXY__origin=*
$ export CORS_PROXY__verbose=false
```

Default values can be found [here](./env/index.js).

Apache KIE (incubating) is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software
Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the name of Apache Incubator. Incubation is
required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that
the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized
in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation
status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the
code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.

Some of the incubating projectâ€™s releases may not be fully compliant with ASF
policy. For example, releases may have incomplete or un-reviewed licensing
conditions. What follows is a list of known issues the project is currently
aware of (note that this list, by definition, is likely to be incomplete):

- Hibernate, an LGPL project, is being used. Hibernate is in the process of
  relicensing to ASL v2
- Some files, particularly test files, and those not supporting comments, may
  be missing the ASF Licensing Header

If you are planning to incorporate this work into your product/project, please
be aware that you will need to conduct a thorough licensing review to determine
the overall implications of including this work. For the current status of this
